Its uncanny timing is not the result of AI wizardry, but rather an explicit reminder syntax that is embedded in an email address.

Adding a reminder to any email is a one-second operation thanks to your email client's address autocomplete.

Example use-cases include:
 * Following up with sales prospects
 * Maintaining relationships
 * Task delegation (put FollowUpThen in the bcc field)
 * Just-in-time reminders to get a task done (pay bills, etc)

Their mission? To bank your stem cells in order to help you live healthier and longer. 

At the core of Forever Labs’ offering is adult stem cell banking. They collect and cryogenically preserve your stem cells, which are essentially the body's raw building blocks capable of morphing into various specialized cells. This is especially important because, as we age, our stem cells diminish in quantity and effectiveness, making the ones you have now exponentially more valuable than any future cells. 

Their approach combines cutting-edge science with practical utility—around 1000 clinical trials are currently leveraging stem cells to treat age-related diseases. By banking your cells, you ensure access to this youthful biology when you might need it most.

Forever Labs operates with a compact team of 12, and offers plans for both annual storage (which starts at a $250 annual recurring fee) and lifetime storage options. They underscore the importance of personal ownership: your stem cells are unique to you, which makes you your own best donor.

For more details, their website is a treasure trove of information on how the process works, from the initial collection by a physician to the secure cryogenic storage in FDA-compliant facilities. And—if you’re curious or have questions—the friendly team at Forever Labs is just a call away at (888) 344-8463.

In a world increasingly focused on healthspan—rather than just lifespan—Forever Labs is positioning itself as a key player in the burgeoning anti-aging and regenerative medicine spaces. So, if you're weighing the idea of banking your stem cells, consider this your nudge to explore the potential benefits. After all, your stem cells will never be as young as they are today.

Goodcover is a Managing General Agent (MGA) that administers personal insurance on behalf of our Membership, a bit like how USAA does it.

Member's premiums are pooled and used to pay claims.  We take a fixed fee, and the remainder is returned in our Annual Member Dividend.

We work with multi-billion dollar capital partners to ensure regulations are followed, adequate claims capital is always available, and we have emergency capacity for catastrophes.

Technology allows us to eliminate waste, saving roughly 25% of the cost.  We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members.

As an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our ""Marketing Budget"" into savings for Members.  This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.
We do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.

Our granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:
    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor
    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)
    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)
    - added coverage for mold removal

Founded in 2017 and part of Y Combinator's S17 batch, Goodcover offers renters insurance at about half the price of traditional providers while delivering superior coverage options. 

As a Managing General Agent (MGA), Goodcover pools member premiums to pay out claims and takes a fixed fee, returning excess funds to members as an annual dividend. This unique approach not only keeps costs down but also aligns the interests of the members—if the pool performs well, they benefit directly.

The technology behind Goodcover allows them to cut out inefficiencies and pass those savings on to users—approximately 25% savings come from streamlining processes that traditional insurers often bloat with agents and advertising expenses. Instead of squeezing profit margins through hidden fees, Goodcover believes in transparent pricing and clear coverage. Plus, the invitation-only membership means members can further reduce their costs by bringing in others, effectively turning Goodcover's marketing budget into savings.

Goodcover offers a range of innovative coverages that go beyond typical policies—think replacement cost coverage for personal property and special provisions for high-value items like computers. They also offer relief for unique scenarios, such as damage from neighboring properties. Their pricing is government-approved and can be 40-60% cheaper than competitors on average.

Headquartered in San Francisco with a lean team of four, Goodcover collaborates with substantial capital partners to ensure compliance and adequate claims handling. Their digital-first approach allows you to get a policy quickly—often in under a minute—without the hassle of meeting in person or lengthy paperwork.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S17,,,"Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients’ specific cancers. That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don’t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

We actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com. 

Our team and the scientific advisory board consisting of leading scientists and researchers from UCLA, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Rutgers University.",,[],"## Oncobox: Revolutionizing Cancer Treatment 

**Mission**: Oncobox is dedicated to finding the right cancer drug for each patient, leveraging tailor-made solutions for personalizing treatment.

### What They Do:

Oncobox started with a clear goal: to address the critical need for a data-driven approach in cancer treatment. Many late-stage cancer patients face the daunting reality of ineffective treatments, often suffering due to the lack of targeted therapy options tailored to their unique genetic makeup. Oncobox's solution? Affordable personalized genetic profiling.

**How It Works**:
- Oncobox Dx analyzes tumor DNA and RNA, focusing on essential molecular pathways and genetic profiles.
- This sophisticated analysis helps clinicians identify the most effective targeted therapies from over 150 available on the market.
- They deliver a clinically actionable report that provides a ranked list of medications likely to benefit specific patients, significantly increasing the effectiveness of treatment.

### Impact:

In a clinical study involving 900 late-stage cancer patients, Oncobox improved the effectiveness of targeted therapies from a mere 25% to an impressive 64%. This kind of data-driven tool is a game changer, as it helps mitigate the risks of ineffective drug trials.

**Partnerships**: The company actively collaborates with pharmaceutical firms, hospitals, payers, and genomic centers to better integrate their innovative solutions into the healthcare landscape.

### Team and Collaboration:

Located in Walnut, CA, and part of Y Combinator’s S17 batch, Oncobox boasts a team of 11 skilled employees and a scientific advisory board with experts from prestigious institutions like UCLA and Johns Hopkins University.

### The Bigger Picture:

While oncology can often feel like a minefield of trial and error, Oncobox is making strides toward a more precise and efficient approach. By utilizing cutting-edge genomic technologies and machine learning, it’s paving the way for what they call “deep molecular profiling,” moving beyond guesswork and toward a future where cancer care is centered around the individual's molecular data.

### Conclusion:

Oncobox is more than just a diagnostics company; it’s a beacon of hope for late-stage cancer patients, offering tailored solutions that could transform their treatment journey.

To get there, we’re taking a different approach than most. We're applying our technologies to every industry where autonomous electric aircraft can be useful, starting with the highest value and most dangerous jobs. In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems. 

We design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.

Today, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA. 

Our cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments. Both vehicles are highly economical to operate, easy to deploy, and significantly reduce C02 emissions in their respective industries.

Founded in 2017 and part of Y Combinator's Summer 2017 batch, this Alameda, CA-based company has set out to revolutionize how we think about air transport across various industries, starting with the most demanding and valuable tasks.

With a crew of 75 talented employees, Pyka crafts an impressive ecosystem of technologies—ranging from proprietary flight control software to high-density motors and custom carbon-fiber airframes. Their innovations are not merely theoretical; they include the Pelican 2, a next-generation aircraft aimed at crop protection, and the upcoming Pelican Cargo, which promises large-scale autonomous cargo transport capabilities.

But what's particularly noteworthy is Pyka's smart, methodical approach. Instead of limiting their focus to niche markets, they’re tackling broader applications of their technology, which includes autonomous aerial applications in agriculture and logistics. Their operations are significantly more economical and greener, cutting down CO2 emissions while enhancing safety and delivery capabilities. They’ve even garnered industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA, paving the way for future endeavors.

Releaf Earth is not just another climate tech startup; it's a dynamic player in the fight against climate change and a champion for African agriculture. Founded in 2017 in Lagos, Nigeria, Releaf Earth was part of the prestigious Y Combinator Batch S17, and it has rapidly distinguished itself as Nigeria’s first industrial biochar producer. At its core, Releaf's mission is clear: turn food waste into biochar to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere, effectively contributing to carbon sequestration while empowering local communities.

### What is Biochar?

Biochar is a form of charcoal produced from biomass through a process called pyrolysis. It has gained traction as a powerful tool for carbon removal and soil enhancement. Releaf Earth focuses on creating premium biochar from palm kernel shells—a resource that is abundant in Africa. By transforming waste into valuable biochar, the company wraps environmental protection in economic empowerment, enhancing soil fertility and enabling rural farmers to increase their productivity.

### The Dual Challenge

Farmers in Africa, particularly in vulnerable communities, are facing a daunting 150% rise in mean temperatures due to the climate crisis they never initiated. Releaf aims to combat this by enhancing crop yields and creating sustainable livelihood opportunities. Their ambitious roadmap includes removing 700,000 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent by 2030 and producing 20,000 metric tons of biochar annually while creating over 500 jobs, half of which they aim to fill with women.

### Innovations at Work

1. **Kraken Technology**: A breakthrough innovation, Kraken is a patented oil palm de-shelling technology tailored for smallholders and off-grid applications. By sourcing palm nuts directly from farmers, Releaf creates agricultural waste in the form of palm kernel shells, which feed their biochar production.

2. **Smart Pyrolysis**: Releaf assesses the optimal pyrolysis manufacturers based on project-specific needs—ensuring every biochar project is tailored to its local context.

3. **Measurement & Verification**: Independent measurement solutions are leveraged to ensure the authenticity of the carbon removal claims Releaf makes through its projects.

4. **Geospatial Planning with SITE**: By developing its own geospatial mapping tool, Releaf locates biochar facilities near sustainable biomass sources, maximizing profitability and efficiency.

### Why Africa?

Africa possesses unique advantages for biochar production:
- **Abundant Biomass**: With around 1.4 billion tons of biomass produced annually, there's no shortage of feedstock for biochar.
- **Cost-Effective Labor**: Labor costs in the region are significantly lower than elsewhere, which optimizes production expenses.
- **Energy Independence**: The production process is self-sustaining, generating its own energy and reducing reliance on external power sources.

### Impact Beyond the Environment

Releaf is committed to not only reversing climate change through innovative technology but also enhancing social equity by prioritizing women in the workforce and supporting rural economies. The goal is clear: to make Releaf Earth the largest carbon removal company by 2030 and catalyze a sustainable revolution across Africa.

In a world where climate change threatens livelihoods and ecosystems, Releaf Earth stands as a beacon of how we can turn waste into wealth, heal our planet, and empower communities.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S17,,,"Skyscrape makes temperature responsive fabrics for a new type of clothing. These fabrics literally change shape in response to a change in temperature: the fabrics become thicker and insulate more as the temperature drops, and they become thinner and insulate less as the temperature rises again. This ""intelligent insulation"" has no wires or sensors, and the fabric's shape-changing behavior comes from a natural materials response. 

Skyscrape’s fabrics offer expanded thermal comfort across a wider temperature range than conventional clothing. Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment.

Skyscrape's first market entry was with Ralph Lauren in the 2022 Team USA Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.",2017.0,[],"Skyscrape, founded in 2017 in Portland, OR, is on a mission to redefine insulation with its innovative temperature-responsive fabrics. Initially, the company aimed to create smart fabrics for clothing that would adapt to temperature changes. Imagine wearing a jacket that automatically becomes thicker and more insulating when it's cold, then thins out when the weather warms up—no wires, no sensors, just a clever use of natural materials reacting to their environment.

The engineering behind this idea is impressive. Skyscrape's fabric structure is such that the yarns expand and contract in response to heat, allowing the garment to adjust its thickness accordingly. After rigorous years of research by a diverse team of scientists, engineers, and designers, Skyscrape was successful in bringing this technology to life. Their breakthrough was showcased during the 2022 Team USA Winter Olympics, where they collaborated with Ralph Lauren.

With only three employees, Skyscrape has already caught the eye of major brands through Y Combinator (Batch S17) and has received backing from the U.S. Department of Energy.

**Founded:** 2017  
**Location:** Palo Alto, California  
**Team Size:** 7 employees  
**Batch:** Y Combinator S17  
**Website:** [getspect.com](http://www.getspect.com)  

**Mission:** Intend to prevent blindness through value-based retinal screening in primary care settings.

### The Problem
Vision diseases cause immeasurable suffering. Globally, 415 million people with diabetes are at risk of conditions like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Glaucoma. Currently, screening for these conditions relies heavily on ophthalmologists, making the process inefficient and costly, especially as the number of patients rises. 

### The Solution
Spect offers a solution that transforms retinal exams into a streamlined, efficient process without needing specialized training for staff. Their portable retinal camera allows screenings for diseases right in the primary care setting—after just 15 minutes of training, existing medical staff can conduct exams with a 95% success rate.

**Efficiency:**
- **Quick Exam Duration:** Retinal exams can be conducted in under 3 minutes.
- **Rapid Reporting:** Results are processed and reported back to healthcare providers within 24 hours.
- **High Gradability:** Over 95% of the images captured are gradable on the first attempt.

**Why it Matters:** Early detection can prevent up to 90% of diabetes-related blindness, and currently, fewer than 40% of diabetes patients receive the recommended annual eye exams. Spect directly addresses this gap by making eye care accessible and integrating seamlessly into existing healthcare workflows.

### Current Partnerships
Spect collaborates with various healthcare providers, including:
- Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
- Community Health Centers
- Independent Physician Associations (IPAs)
- Health Systems and more

Notable partners include **DocGo**, which has leveraged Spect's technology to increase diabetic retinal screenings significantly, and **Maryland Community Health System**, where Spect's solutions have enhanced the implementation of diabetic eye examinations.

### Recent Highlights
- In 2024, Spect partnered with DocGo to address care gaps and enhance eye and vision health.
- Featured in the UCSF Healthhub Digital Health Awards for innovative solutions.

### Conclusion
Spect isn’t just another health tech company; it’s a response to a critical healthcare challenge. With a value-driven approach to retinal screening, Spect’s mission to prevent blindness is not only admirable but also achievable with their cutting-edge solutions. The combination of technology, ease of use, and rigorous focus on data privacy positions them for significant impact in healthcare.
