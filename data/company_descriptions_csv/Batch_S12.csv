,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S12,,,"Vastrm Fashionâ¢ (pronounced vas' trum) Vastrm was started to solve a basic problem: Shirts that donât fit well!

Mass produced shirts were meant to accommodate a wide variety of body types with one standard size, and different brands have different sizing standards, making shopping difficult--many men must shop in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits! By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.

Tang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit.",2012.0,[],"Let’s talk about Vastrm, a company dedicated to revolutionizing the way we think about fitting shirts—because let’s face it, most off-the-rack apparel just doesn’t cut it. Founded in 2012 and hailing from Burlingame, California, Vastrm’s mission is centered around a simple yet powerful idea: mass customized active apparel. The name ""Vastrm,"" derived from Sanskrit meaning ""cloth,"" reflects a commitment to quality and fit that most apparel brands miss.

The problem Vastrm is tackling is something many of us know all too well: finding shirts that fit well is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Traditional sizing is based on broad averages, which means countless trips to various stores—often leaving customers feeling frustrated. Vastrm solves this issue by offering a home try-on program and custom fit adjustments. This way, you’re not just left with a shirt that could fit; you get one that **does** fit—perfectly tailored to your unique body.

The idea sparked when founder Jonathan Tang learned about a customer who found a perfect-fitting shirt in Italy. Rather than leave the hunt to chance or traditional methods, Tang took it upon himself to adjust Vastrm’s shirts to replicate that fit. This personal touch highlights Vastrm’s philosophy: every body is different, and clothing should honor that.

As part of Y Combinator's Summer 2012 batch, Vastrm is positioned at the intersection of customization and lifestyle. With a small team of two, the company is agile enough to keep its focus on quality and personal service. The fact that they offer **24 different styles and adjustments without additional fees** really speaks volumes about their commitment to customer satisfaction.

Vastrm isn’t just about shirts; it’s about empowering individuals to express themselves through clothing that feels tailor-made. They understand that luxurious quality and attention to detail can make all the difference in how you feel throughout your day. Curious to see more? You can check out their offerings on their website, [vastrm.com](http://vastrm.com).

In summary, Vastrm is carving a niche in the apparel market by providing a smart, customizable solution for a common pain point in clothing: fit. They are a great example of how understanding the customer's needs can lead to innovative solutions that don’t just meet expectations—they exceed them.",,,Mass customized active apparel.
