Yet, Chinese factories seem undifferentiated because they all make the same, unverifiable claims of excellence. 

This results in competition centered on price. Factories are forced to under-bid contracts to win business, but often, they later surprise the customer with quality problems and delays.

This process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.

We charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).

They specialize in advanced manufacturing and distribution solutions, particularly focusing on transforming how product companies leverage Chinese factories for production. 

The problem in this sector is pretty straightforward: many Chinese factories make lofty claims about excellence, yet the reality is that they often undercut prices to snag contracts. This race to the bottom leads to quality issues and unexpected delays, which is frustrating for everyone involved. Assembly tackles this broken system head-on by equipping factories with cameras and remote monitoring software. This technology ensures compliance with quality standards, reduces liability, and even combats warranty fraud.

Their business model is innovative and aligned with better factory practices. They charge a nominal per-unit fee to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and share revenue with factories that can prove their compliance with established quality metrics. Essentially, they’re incentivizing good behavior and creating a clear audit trail that helps these factories attract more foreign business.

One impressive statistic—defect rates typically drop by 75% within just five months after Assembly implements its systems. That’s transformative.

Assembly doesn't just stop at monitoring; they provide a range of services. Their model includes helping businesses source, verify, inspect, and optimize their supply chains while managing factories more efficiently with tech. They even offer warehousing and shipping solutions to ensure products safely reach consumers—decreasing returns and costs.

On top of this, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Assembly stepped up by supplying personal protective equipment (PPE), showcasing their adaptability and commitment to public health.

With a small but efficient team of 12, led by their Group Partner, Nan, Assembly is making waves in logistics and manufacturing across the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. Their focus on quality and compliance could very well redefine how we think about manufacturing in China—and that’s exciting.

Heart failure is a chronic condition that places a hefty burden on the healthcare system, costing around $35 billion yearly. Bodyport's solution addresses this by empowering care teams with actionable data, enabling timely interventions that can improve patient outcomes and quality of life. 

Their approach combines advanced sensor technology with proprietary algorithms to provide a holistic view of heart health, making it easier for both patients and providers to make informed decisions. The benefit? A streamlined experience that seamlessly integrates into patients' daily lives and provides direct feedback to their healthcare teams.

In a world where health technologies are evolving rapidly, Bodyport is making strides that promise to bring significant improvements to the lives of those with chronic heart issues. With their tagline, ""One simple step to care for your heart,"" they remind us that health management can—and should—be as effortless as stepping on a scale.

Such validations not only underscore the effectiveness of their models but also their adherence to the highest standards in diagnostic development.

One of the standout achievements of Cofactor's technology is its application in immunotherapy. During a clinical study presented by members of the NCCN—who shape patient treatment guidelines—Cofactor's assessments demonstrated a marked proficiency in predicting how patients will respond to immunotherapeutics. Given the escalating demand for effective immunotherapy solutions, this could tap into a market worth over $1 billion.

Cofactor isn't just about innovations in the lab; they’re taking their insights to a broader spectrum, targeting 50% of cancer diagnoses in the U.S. This is no small ambition and showcases their commitment to affecting real change in oncology.

The company's successes have attracted investment from renowned firms such as Menlo Ventures, DCVC, and Ascension Ventures, with the latter representing the funding arms for 13 National U.S. Healthcare Systems.

Their ongoing projects, including the **PREDAPT Trial**, aim to leverage their OncoPrism assay to assess immunotherapy responses for 11 different solid tumors. With partnerships across more than 24 healthcare systems, Cofactor is vital in generating data that pushes the boundaries of what's achievable in personalized cancer care.

With a core team of 13 creative minds, Cofactor Genomics is pushing forward the envelope of what precision diagnostics can do. As they venture into new partnerships and expand their technology reach—tapping into various cancer types—they could very well redefine how we understand treatment responses in the evolving world of oncology.

With 1.8 billion people lacking adequate housing, New Story focuses on making land and financing accessible for families in vulnerable situations. This innovative, market-based approach allows families to build credit, invest in property, and cultivate wealth over time. For instance, families who secured land in Mexico saw their net worth grow twofold in just four years. This isn't your traditional charity model; it's an investment in potential.

**Empowering Women**  
Particularly enlightening is their initiative in Etzatlán, Mexico, where over 941 low-income families became landowners, 60% of whom are led by women—significantly above the national average. This empowerment doesn't just unlock homes but enhances household security, proving that when women own property, they uplift entire communities.

**Getting Involved**  
New Story operates on the foundation of collaboration and community support. Interested individuals can get involved through donations, becoming impact investors, or corporate partnerships. Not only is this about giving—it's about building a sustainable model that thrives on shared value and collaboration.

**Final Thoughts**  
As the global housing crisis continues to loom, New Story stands out with a pragmatic and innovative approach to one of humanity's most pressing issues. They invite everyone to join a journey that transforms not just houses but lives, focusing on empowerment and systemic change.

#### Mission: 
ShapeScale is on a mission to revolutionize personal health tracking. It’s not just about stepping on a scale; it's about understanding your body in 3D. This innovative health tech startup has developed the ShapeScale—a personal 3D scanner and fitness tracker that helps users visualize their physical changes over time, identifying where fat is lost and muscle is gained.

---

#### Product Highlights:
- **ShapeScale:** A state-of-the-art device that scans your body in photorealistic 3D, capturing every detail. This isn't just a fancy gimmick; it’s a powerful tool for anyone serious about tracking their fitness progress.
- **Visual Feedback:** Users can see their changes through heatmaps that highlight specific areas where their body composition has evolved, making it easier to set and refine fitness goals.
- **Health Scores:** The device provides actionable insights by generating health and body scores, helping users stay focused on areas that need improvement and gauge the effectiveness of their regimen.

---

#### Why It Matters:
Traditional scales can often mislead. You might be losing fat but not seeing weight drop due to muscle gain. ShapeScale aims to change the conversation by introducing visuals as a driving force for motivation—after all, seeing is believing. 

As Michael Seibel from Y Combinator puts it, ""It’s like a better mirror that gives you a clear, unbiased view of yourself."" Moreover, fitness buffs and casual users alike will appreciate its utility; it acts like a personal trainer that can show your progress in a way that just stepping on a scale can’t.

#### What’s Next:
Shape (ShapeScale) is currently making strides in the health and fitness landscape, not just by selling a product, but by changing how people approach their wellness journey. Keep an eye on this company—it’s positioned at the intersection of hardware, computer vision, and consumer health services, and it's just getting started.

Founded in 2015 as part of Y Combinator's S15 batch, Verge Genomics is carving a niche in the biotechnology sector by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and extensive human data to expedite drug development. Based in San Francisco with a dynamic team of around 50, the company champions the mission of delivering better drugs faster by harnessing cutting-edge technology.

Verge has developed an innovative, all-in-human drug discovery platform known as CONVERGE®, utilizing a massive proprietary multi-omics database sourced directly from human tissue. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods that often rely on animal or cell models. By applying advanced machine learning techniques, Verge uncovers insights into the complex causes of diseases, aiming to transform these insights into promising drug candidates.

The company is focused on tackling significant medical challenges, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia—conditions currently without effective treatments. Notably, Verge's first drug, VRG50635, a small molecule inhibitor aimed at ALS, has already progressed to clinical trials in just four years. This rapid transition from research to clinic encapsulates their commitment to accelerating drug discovery.

Under the leadership of Dalton Caldwell, Verge is not just a biotech firm; it's a culture of innovation, collaboration, and relentless pursuit of breakthroughs in healthcare. They are actively seeking partnerships with industry leaders to reshape the drug discovery landscape.
