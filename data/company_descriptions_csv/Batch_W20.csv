However, antibodies- especially ones that activate and modulate cell surface receptors- are hard to find. Abalone Bio expands the playing field for antibody therapeutics and enables us to previously access treatments for untreated diseases.

**Mission:** Abalone Bio is on a quest to uncover antibody drugs that others have overlooked. They aim to revolutionize how we treat diseases by focusing on the challenges inherent in accessing hard-to-target biological pathways.

**Founded:** 2018, Abalone Bio emerged from innovative thought, sitting comfortably in the esteemed Y Combinator Batch W20.

**Location:** Based in Emeryville, CA, a hub for biotech and innovation in the San Francisco Bay Area.

**Team:** A nimble team of 12 experts, each bringing deep knowledge from various fields like machine learning, synthetic biology, and drug discovery. They also have support from their Group Partner, Nan.

### The Challenge

Antibodies, the backbone of modern therapeutics, are incredibly specific but can be hard to find, especially those that activate and modulate cell surface receptors—like switches that translate external signals into internal actions. The result? Many promising drug targets remain untreated, leaving millions of patients without effective therapies.

### The Solution

Enter Abalone Bio's **Functional Antibody Selection Technology (FAST)**, a platform designed to quickly generate antibody activators for notoriously difficult targets, specifically focusing on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The significance of this approach is immense as GPCRs regulate a vast array of biological responses.

1. **Massive Parallelism:** Abalone Bio’s technology allows the examination of 100 million antibodies simultaneously. This scale is about 100 times more than what traditional methods can achieve. In essence, they measure the activity of potential antibodies, not just their ability to bind.

2. **AI Integration:** They've integrated artificial intelligence into the process to predict which antibodies will be effective, a pioneering move within the industry.

3. **Real-World Impact:** They are currently developing a novel antibody designed to treat neuropathic pain, among other conditions that traditional treatments often fail to address. Their discoveries also open up options for tackling inflammatory and fibrotic diseases—each representing billion-dollar markets.

### The Leadership Team

- **Richard Yu, PhD** - CEO and Co-Founder: A veteran in the startup realm with a background in biophysics and computer science.
- **Toshi Takeuchi, PhD** - CSO: With over 20 years of industry expertise, Toshi drives R&D efforts and academic partnerships.
- **Monica Schwartz, PhD** - VP of Antibody Discovery: Spearheads early discovery efforts and platform technology development.
- **Lauren Schwimmer** - VP of Preclinical Development: A seasoned developer responsible for numerous successful antibody drug programs.
- **Sameer Soi** - VP of Data Science & AI: Focuses on leveraging data and machine learning to optimize the drug discovery process.

### Conclusion

Abalone Bio isn’t just about creating drugs; it's about redefining the possibilities of treatments that could profoundly improve lives. With a focus on cutting-edge technology and an ambitious leadership team, they are positioned to make significant strides in the therapeutic landscape. As they tackle unmet medical needs, the potential for impact is vast—both in terms of revenue and, more importantly, human health.

For wealthy Africans and their asset managers, investing in the global capital markets is cumbersome, expensive and practically inaccessible. In Nigeria, Africa's largest economy and home to 30% of all the wealth in Sub Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), 99.99% of the investing population do not have access to invest globally. Even for the 0.01%, if you wanted to buy a US stock, youâd have to call your asset manager who would then call an international broker to execute a trade. This is inefficient & expensive!
We have a mobile app that allows individuals trade the US stock markets by themselves and a brokerage tool for asset managers to execute trades directly & manage multilple portfolios seamlessly.",2019.0,[],"**Company Overview: Bamboo**

Founded in 2019 and operating out of Lagos, Nigeria, Bamboo is positioning itself as the go-to platform for wealthy Africans seeking to tap into global securities markets. Think of it as the Fidelity of Africa—a one-stop online brokerage that provides direct access to U.S. stocks and other investments that have been hard to reach for the majority of investors on the continent.

**The Problem It's Solving:**
For many affluent individuals and their asset managers in Africa, the traditional process of investing globally is not just cumbersome but also expensive and time-consuming. In Nigeria, for instance, a staggering 99.99% of potential investors lack access to international markets. Even those who do often face a clunky system where trades are executed through indirect channels—think: calling your asset manager, who then rings an international broker. Bamboo seeks to streamline this process.

**The Solution:**
Bamboo's mobile app simplifies investing by allowing users to trade U.S. stocks independently. Asset managers, too, can use its robust brokerage tools to manage multiple portfolios efficiently. The platform supports fractional investing, meaning users can invest any amount in shares of their choice, lowering the barrier to entry significantly.

**Security and Compliance:**
Bamboo places a strong emphasis on security, employing state-of-the-art data encryption and two-factor authentication to protect users' accounts. They are backed by reputable financial operators and are compliant with the Securities and Exchange Commission both in Nigeria and the U.S. Notably, U.S. stock portfolios held through the platform are insured by SIPC up to $500,000, which adds an extra layer of reassurance for investors.

**User Experience:**
Getting started with Bamboo is designed to be easy and straightforward. Users create an account, verify their identity, fund their wallets, and begin investing—all within a few clicks. The app offers exposure to a variety of marketplaces, including equity stocks, ETFs, and fixed return investments.

**Community and Learning:**
Bamboo fosters a vibrant community where first-time and seasoned investors can learn from one another, vote on new features, and share strategies. The platform also provides educational resources that aim to demystify the investment process, empowering users to make informed decisions.

**Current Status:**
Bamboo is part of Y Combinator's Batch W20, and has already garnered over 500,000 registered users. It operates with a lean team of 14 employees but is making a considerable impact in the fintech landscape of Africa. Michael Seibel serves as their Group Partner, signaling strong backing from established entrepreneurs and innovators.

**What Lies Ahead:**
As Bamboo continues to grow, it aims to further close the investment gap for Africans, making global and local investing not just a dream but a reality. If you're looking for straightforward investment opportunities in a previously inaccessible market, Bamboo might just be the platform you need.

Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.

The user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.

Our unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement.

Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.

Breathe Well-being is an innovative digital health startup based in New Delhi, India, focused on helping people prevent and manage chronic lifestyle diseases, particularly through weight loss and diabetes reversal. Founded as part of Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch, the company operates like a weight-loss clinic in the cloud—imagine Noom, but tailored to the Indian market.

### Mission
The core mission of Breathe Well-being is straightforward: to provide a comprehensive digital well-being program that empowers individuals to take control of their health, primarily by focusing on behaviors that lead to sustainable weight loss and management of chronic conditions like Type 2 Diabetes.

### Program Overview
Breathe Well-being's program is delivered remotely via a mobile app and phone-based coaching, making it super accessible. Users can partake in bi-weekly one-on-one coaching sessions focusing on behavioral changes, supplemented by a supportive online community and a variety of tracking tools and educational resources. The gamification aspect—like weekly challenges—keeps users motivated and engaged.

By utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), Breathe Well-being's coaching methodology encourages users to dismantle negative thought patterns associated with past health failures, linking achievable short-term goals to their personal values. The result? Users learn to identify their own triggers for unhealthy habits and make better lifestyle choices.

### Effectiveness
Their approach has proven effective: users have reported significant weight loss and reduced or eliminated reliance on medications for chronic conditions. For instance, statistics indicate that 84% of participants have reduced their dependency on medication, and 90% of participants experience a decrease in HbA1c levels, a key marker in diabetes management.

### Business Needs
Currently, Breathe Well-being is grappling with improving their sales processes—specifically, they want to increase the conversion rates of users who complete their one-week free trial. They aim to identify triggers that prompt users to enroll and streamline the payment process to make it as seamless as possible.

### Team and Expertise
Breathe Well-being operates with a small, dedicated team of 15, leveraging the expertise of over 100 health coaches, dietitians, and diabetologists. Their professional backgrounds are diverse, with each team member bringing significant experience in areas like endocrinology, nutrition, and fitness to support users on their health journeys.

At its core, BuildBuddy is designed as an open-core product, offering robust features for individual developers for free, while larger enterprises can benefit from the more comprehensive tools and 24/7 support. This dual approach not only serves to build community trust but also aligns with the growing trend of making advanced technology accessible to smaller teams and open-source projects.

Currently, BuildBuddy operates with a compact but effective team of 15, led by Group Partner Dalton Caldwell, which allows for agile responses to customer needs and a nurturing of the company’s culture. They’ve attracted impressive clientele, including renowned engineering teams from companies like Spotify, Cisco, and Asana, solidifying their reputation in the developer tools space.

Being part of Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch, Candid Health quickly positioned itself as a player in the digital health ecosystem.

At the core of Candid Health's mission lies its revenue cycle automation platform. This platform is designed for healthcare providers, streamlining and optimizing every facet of the revenue cycle—from billing issues to insurance collections. The company employs around 55 people, including a prominent Group Partner, Gustaf Alstromer, which indicates a robust support system for their growth.

Candid's features are built around three key pillars: automation, integrations, and data reporting. The platform aims to prevent claim issues before they occur, ensuring that employees spend less time on billing errors and more time focused on patient care. For instance, users can automate repetitive tasks, seamlessly integrate their existing systems with flexible APIs, and access real-time reporting to identify opportunities for improvement.

Their automation capabilities are particularly notable. Candid Health not only detects billing issues but proactively fixes them, enabling teams to recoup revenues without manual fuss. This modern approach to revenue cycle management allows healthcare providers to allocate their resources more effectively—one customer remarked that switching to Candid saved her 20 hours a week previously spent managing billing tasks.

Candid Health garners trust from a growing list of digital health companies, demonstrating its impact in the space (the logos of several partner companies featured prominently on their site). The company is poised for growth, and its mission to make billing ""our problem, not yours"" resonates well in a sector that struggles under the weight of administrative burdens.

In summary, Candid Health is simplifying an aspect of healthcare that everyone dreads—billing. With their automation platform, they are not just helping providers make sense of their finances but also freeing them up to do what they do best: care for patients. If you're in the healthcare field and dealing with the headaches of revenue cycle management, Candid Health is definitely worth a look.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W20,,,"We are developing a drug to increase metabolism and burn calories without exercise.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year. Existing drugs are not effective enough to reverse the trend. Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders â the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure.

Our drug will target mitochondria â the powerhouse of the cell â to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.

For decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does. We are realizing this dream at Equator Therapeutics.",,[],"**Equator Therapeutics: A Revolutionary Approach to Metabolic Disorders**

Equator Therapeutics is tackling one of the most pressing health issues of our time: obesity and type 2 diabetes, which now affect over 2.2 billion and 500 million people globally, respectively. Founded in San Francisco and part of Y Combinator's W20 batch, their mission is clear: to create a drug that increases metabolism and burns calories without the need for exercise. This is more than just lofty rhetoric; it’s a response to a growing epidemic, where traditional weight loss methods often fall short.

### The Problem with Current Solutions

Most existing treatments for obesity and metabolic disorders revolve around dieting and exercise. However, many people struggle to maintain weight loss through these methods alone. Equator Therapeutics recognizes that there's a third critical mechanism at play: thermogenesis, the process through which our bodies burn calories.

Historically, inducing thermogenesis in humans has been challenging. Previous methods required synthetic interventions that came with unpleasant side effects. But Equator has made a breakthrough by identifying the protein that natural mitochondria—a cell's powerhouse—use to generate heat. By harnessing this mechanism, Equator aims to help restore thermogenesis to levels found in our ancestors, enhancing calorie burning effortlessly throughout daily activities.

### Innovative Drug Discovery Platform

At the heart of Equator's approach is a high-throughput drug discovery platform. This technology allows them to identify compounds that selectively activate mitochondrial proteins, promoting safe thermogenesis without negative side effects. Initial animal studies demonstrate full reversals of obesity and type 2 diabetes, raising hopes that these results can translate to human applications.

What makes Equator particularly exciting is its commitment to exploring multiple avenues in mitochondrial medicine, expanding beyond thermogenesis into other therapeutic mechanisms.

### A Team of Experts

Equator Therapeutics is led by a passionate team of scientists and innovators:

- **Jonah Sinick, Ph.D.** - Co-founder and CEO
- **Yuriy Kirichok, Ph.D.** - Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer
- **Katherine Widdowson, Ph.D.** - Head of Medicinal Chemistry

The company's scientific advisory board includes notable figures from institutions like Yale and UCSF, further solidifying their credibility and expertise in the field.

### Looking Forward

With a team of just two employees, Equator is leveraging cutting-edge scientific research to challenge the status quo in metabolic disorder treatment. The implications of their work could lead to a paradigm shift in how we address obesity and related diseases—treatments that could one day feel as natural as breathing, all while restoring our innate ability to burn calories.

Equator Therapeutics is not just about creating a drug; they’re on a mission to change lives by making calorie burning as effortless as it should be. The promise of making thermogenesis pharmacological might be the step humanity has long awaited in the battle against obesity.

They've taken on a mission that's both ambitious and essential: building advanced satellite communication (satcom) user terminals. This isn't just tech for tech's sake; it's about democratizing access to the internet, particularly in regions where it’s sorely lacking. Currently, one in three people around the globe lacks adequate internet access, and Farcast sees their technology as a potential game-changer.

Originally branded as UTVATE, the company has changed its name but retained its focus on innovation. It's a small but agile team, with about 12 employees, spearheaded by CEO Siamak Ebadi and guided by Group Partner Jared Friedman. Their technology centers around cutting-edge Flat Panel Antennas (FPAs) that effectively tackle the challenges of satellite tracking through electronic beam scanning. Simply put, they make satellite internet more accessible, smaller, lighter, and cheaper—what they term ""SWaP-C"" (Size, Weight, Power, and Cost).

Their clientele is impressive too, boasting partnerships with notable companies like Viasat and the Air Force. The Farcast team is committed to bridging the digital divide, believing that internet access should be a right, not a privilege. With the support of key investors and a solid foundation, they’re on a path to unlock global prosperity through better connectivity.

In terms of company culture, they’re focused on creating a rewarding workplace, offering benefits like unlimited PTO, parental leave, 401(k) matching, and more. As they continue to grow, they’re not just looking for employees; they’re inviting like-minded innovators to join them in their mission to change how the world connects.

Born in 2017 out of the founders’ frustration with conventional credit systems, Grain’s mission is to transform debit cards into credit cards by linking them to a line of credit informed by real cash flow. This offers a lifeline to millennials, Gen Zs, and immigrants—essentially, about 100 million people—who often fear falling into the quagmire of credit card debt.

After initially rolling out their consumer credit app—which for six years served around 470,000 users—Grain pivoted in 2023 to focus on two new flagship products: **Velex** and **Atlas**. Velex provides an automated cash-flow scoring solution, allowing financial institutions to assess borrower risk more effectively, while Atlas serves as a comprehensive portfolio management tool for various loan types and credit services.

Grain stands out not just for its innovative approach but also for its commitment to financial inclusivity. By simplifying access to credit, they’re aiming to democratize financial opportunities for those previously marginalized by traditional banking norms. With a team of 30, Grain is part of Y Combinator's Batch W20, suggesting that they’re not just a vision, but a startup with the backing and potential to make significant waves in the finance sector.

That’s where we learned that 73% of people who find a hotel room on Booking.com or Expedia also check the hotel website to see if the price is cheaper.  Independent hotels are missing these opportunities because they haven’t figured out that they should offer extras, discounts, and better user experience in order to drive bookings on their websites to avoid paying 15-25% commissions to OTAs.

**Overview:**
Founded in 2019 and based in Mexico City, GuruHotel is on a mission to revolutionize the independent hotel sector by providing them with tools to capitalize on direct bookings. Taglined as “The Shopify for the hotel industry”, GuruHotel empowers these hotels to take control of their websites and booking processes, aiming to increase direct sales and reduce dependency on Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Booking.com and Expedia.

**The Problem:**
Independent hotels often struggle with online visibility and booking efficiency. Research found that a staggering 73% of hotel seekers comparing prices still visit the hotel’s website after checking OTAs, indicating a huge opportunity for hotels to capture additional bookings directly. However, many are unable to offer competitive pricing, additional incentives, or an optimized user experience necessary to effectively convert these visitors.

**The Solution:**
GuruHotel addresses these challenges by automating the process of building hotel websites and integrating booking functionalities that are synchronized with real-time inventory. Hotels can launch a professional website in under 60 seconds, which helps them avoid paying hefty OTA commissions, which typically range from 15% to 25%.

**Core Features:**
1. **Automated Website Creation**: Set up a professional hotel website quickly with real-time inventory synchronization.
2. **Customer Support Tools**: Ensure guests have a seamless booking experience with tailored assistance.
3. **Multiple Payment Options**: Fast, secure payment methods, including credit cards and mobile payments.
4. **Multi-Language and Currency Support**: Cater to a global audience by allowing guests to choose their preferred language and currency.

**Market Position & Strategy:**
GuruHotel taps into the fintech and SaaS markets within the travel industry, strategically positioning itself for success as it seeks to empower independent hotels. By offering a free and maintenance-free solution, with no upfront infrastructure costs, they make it viable for hotels to shift bookings away from OTAs.

**Team and Recognition:**
With a team of about 50 and backed by notable investors, including Y Combinator, GuruHotel is well-equipped to expand its services and reach. They’ve been recognized as an industry champion at the SiteMinder Partner of the Year Awards in 2023, further solidifying their credibility and market relevance.

**Why Now?**
The timing for GuruHotel couldn’t be better. Just as Shopify transformed e-commerce by giving small businesses the tools to sell directly and maintain control, GuruHotel aims to do the same for the hotel industry. It’s a clear pivot towards empowering hoteliers to enhance their operational efficiency and revenue generation.

In summary, GuruHotel is more than just a product; it's a vital tool for independent hotels wanting to reclaim their autonomy in a landscape dominated by OTAs. If you're in the hotel business and looking to boost your direct bookings, GuruHotel is worth a look.

Founded in 2019 by a small team of seasoned founders, Infield's mission is clear—""Safer, faster dependency upgrades."" They emerged from the Y Combinator W20 batch and are based in New York, boasting a lean team of five.

The essence of what Infield does is about automating the often tedious process of keeping software dependencies up-to-date. No more losing time reading changelogs, assessing risks, or wrestling with packages. Instead, Infield leverages automation and expertise to streamline this crucial aspect of software maintenance so that engineering teams can focus their efforts on shipping new features instead of getting bogged down in upkeep.

### How It Works

Getting started is designed to be painless. Users can connect their code via a GitHub app or Infield's CLI tool. Once linked, Infield assesses the project's upgrade status, mapping out a living upgrade plan that factors in risks and dependencies—essentially laying out a roadmap for potential upgrades.

The core service offers a “white glove” experience, meaning Infield can handle the heavy lifting of upgrading dependencies on behalf of their clients. For teams that prefer a more hands-on approach, they also provide software-only plans to enhance their internal upgrade efforts.

### Why It Stands Out

Infield sets itself apart from other tools like Dependabot by not just notifying teams of upgrades but actively managing the process, including fixing breaking changes and providing in-depth changelog research. They tackle the nuances that simple scanners might overlook, ensuring a more reliable and secure update process.

### Current Offering

Infield supports major programming languages such as Ruby, JavaScript, and Python, with plans to add Java soon. They have a strong roster of clients, including world-class engineering teams, ensuring that their service is trusted across the board.

Infield’s unique combination of automating dependency management while offering expert human oversight positions it favorably in a space that’s becoming increasingly complex as technology evolves.

Many of growing businesses in Asia are highly ""bankable"" yet 50-70% are unable to obtain capital to grow their business.

Having been business owners ourselves, we experienced firsthand the struggles of funding a business - from expensive equity options to loans that required personal guarantees.

We went live in Singapore first to validate the product/market fit. We plan to expand across the APAC region..

Our sweet spot is backing repeatable business spend - expenses that leads to increased revenue. Our financing product allows businesses to keep growing with us over time. Over a third of our advances today are from repeat borrowers.

We created a brand new asset class in Asia - offering flexible repayment options, such as tieing repayment with sales. Business owners LOVE this.

Our automated financial technology platform ingests revenue and alternative data sources that gives us a proprietary edge in understanding the behavior of our borrowers. As we collect continuous data, we are able to offer better financial and technology solutions, while mitigating our downside risk.

**The Problem and the Solution**

It's a common scenario—many businesses in Asia are ""bankable"" but still find themselves cut off from vital funding, with up to 70% unable to secure financing. As former business owners, the founders of Jenfi understand this struggle all too well. They sought to eradicate the headache of expensive equity financing and the burdensome requirements of traditional loans.

By launching first in Singapore, Jenfi validated its product-market fit and is now poised for expansion across the APAC region. They specialize in backing repeatable business expenses that drive revenue growth. Not just a one-time fix, Jenfi’s approach unfolds over time, fostering repeat borrowing relationships—over a third of their advances are from clients who return for more.

**Innovative Financing Model**

Jenfi's competitive edge lies in its novel asset class and flexible repayment options—business owners can repay a percentage of their revenue. This model aligns closely with the businesses they serve, particularly digital and e-commerce companies. Made possible through their automated and technology-driven platform, Jenfi processes revenue data and other alternative data sources to assess borrower behavior, which in turn informs better financing solutions.

Funds are managed through a virtual Jenfi Wallet and charged via a MasterCard, ensuring real-time tracking of expenditures—a perfect blend of autonomy and oversight.

**Highlights and Achievements**

- **Team and Growth**: Jenfi consists of a dedicated team of 18 employees and is part of Y Combinator's Batch W20.
  
- **Performance**: Companies funded by Jenfi experience impressive growth, averaging 8.1% monthly—a staggering 156% annualized growth.

Jenfi is on a mission to dismantle the barriers to capital that hinder digital businesses from thriving. If you’re a digital entrepreneur in need of capital without the weight of giving up equity, Jenfi’s innovative financing solutions might just be the lifeline you’re looking for.

Founded in 2020 and based in San Francisco, Letterdrop is a member of Y Combinator's W20 batch and has assembled a focused team of 10 passionate individuals. At its core, Letterdrop's mission is simple yet powerful: to automate social selling to help businesses book more meetings. The company offers a fresh approach to lead generation, emphasizing the importance of engaging with warm leads instead of drowning in cold outreach, which often yields a puny 1% success rate.

### What They Do

Initially focused on targeting leads interested in the problems they solve and competitive dynamics, Letterdrop has evolved into a sophisticated platform. They help sales and marketing teams find warm leads—those already acquainted with your brand or the relevant issues—enabling a more efficient outreach strategy and, as a result, a significantly improved booking rate of 3.8 times compared to traditional methods. 

Letterdrop integrates thought leadership into the sales process. By automating the nurturing of leads through rich content generated from sales calls, it ensures that your team consistently attracts and retains the attention of potential buyers.

### Why Letterdrop?

Letterdrop makes it easy for sales and marketing professionals to maximize their outreach potential, with the following key benefits:

- **Effortless Set-Up:** With just a 45-minute onboarding process, users can start seeing meaningful outputs almost immediately.
- **Automated Lead Identification:** It diligently surfaces relevant leads who are familiar with your offerings or the competition, pushing these insights directly into your CRM or Slack.
- **Nurtured Relationships:** Instead of bombarding prospects with cold emails, Letterdrop allows for thoughtful engagement with leads, tailoring conversations to those already expressing interest.

### Results and Impact

Users of Letterdrop have reported closing significant pipeline gaps, averaging around **$1.4 million** in new opportunities. The platform has proven especially beneficial for sales, demand generation, and revenue operations teams, demonstrating real results within just 30 days of utilization. 

For example, one marketing VP noted their sales team progressed from sporadic social media interactions to daily engagement, directly attributed to their use of Letterdrop. Another user transformed a few warm leads into $200,000 in closed deals in under a month.

### Target Audience

Here’s who thrives on Letterdrop:
- VP Marketing: Build inbound engines tied to revenue.
- Content Marketers: Create impactful, resonating content for buyers.
- VP Sales: Establish trust and credibility to enhance meeting bookings.

### Why It Matters

In today's crowded digital landscape, traditional outbound strategies often place sellers on the back foot, competing against an avalanche of spammy outreach. Instead, Letterdrop encourages businesses to pivot toward building genuine relationships with potential buyers, moving towards an inbound-led sales strategy that feels more authentic and less forced.

Founded in 2019 and hailing from Charleston, SC, Living Carbon is on a mission to combat climate change by genetically enhancing plants to capture and store more carbon dioxide (CO2). This innovative approach positions the company at the intersection of synthetic biology, biotechnology, climate science, and agriculture—their work is both cutting-edge and crucial for our planet's future.

Living Carbon initially started as a public benefit corporation, emphasizing its commitment to positive environmental impact. With a diverse and dedicated team of 40 employees, they are actively engaged in a range of initiatives aimed at restoring degraded land through innovative reforestation projects. Notably, they are now enrolling landowners to participate in these efforts to restore abandoned mineland and improve agricultural lands. By offering financial incentives to landowners, Living Carbon helps to rejuvenate ecosystems, support biodiversity, and generate sustainable income streams.

One of the standout components of Living Carbon’s strategy is their development of fast-growing poplar trees that significantly enhance biomass accumulation compared to traditional varieties. These custom-grown biomass feedstocks not only serve their carbon capture goals but also can be tailored to meet corporate supply chain needs.

Additionally, the company is advancing high-quality carbon removal projects across the United States, ensuring genuine benefits through rigorous methods known as true additionality with minimal leakage. This is complemented by their efforts to procure carbon credits, providing a market-based approach to incentivize carbon reduction.

Supported by their participation in Y Combinator's W20 batch, Living Carbon is positioned to leverage key partnerships—including one with Gustaf Alstromer, a Group Partner at Y Combinator—to escalate their impact and reach within the biotech landscape. 

As climate change continues to loom large, the work of Living Carbon represents a beacon of hope, demonstrating that with innovative thinking and effective application of genetic technologies, we can enlist nature itself as a solution to one of humanity's greatest challenges.

It emerged from Y Combinator's W20 batch and has grown to a team of 22 employees. The company positions itself as a DecisionOps platform aimed at empowering optimization AI teams with robust tools for deploying, testing, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), collaboration, and management of decision models.

The core mission of Nextmv is straightforward: to simplify and accelerate the process of creating scalable, custom decision services that can easily integrate with popular solvers and modeling solutions via unique API endpoints. This is particularly relevant for industries involved in logistics and supply-chain management, where decision-making processes can intrinsically benefit from enhanced optimization practices fueled by AI.

Nextmv’s platform addresses several common challenges that teams face when moving from research to operational deployment of decision models. For instance, teams often struggle with messy handovers from development to production, requiring bespoke tools for testing and collaboration. Nextmv offers a solution that streamlines the entire lifecycle of decision models, helping teams transition their innovations into live operations more efficiently.

Some of the standout features of Nextmv include:
- A DecisionOps workflow for efficient model validation and management.
- A model marketplace tailored for specific use cases.
- Comprehensive support for a variety of modeling and solver integrations, both commercial and open source.
- Tools that allow teams to bring their own code, ensuring that existing solutions can be unified and managed in a single platform.

In practical terms, this means that operations researchers, data scientists, software developers, and even business stakeholders can all benefit. Researchers can focus on modeling rather than building support tools, while developers can easily integrate and monitor models as services. Business stakeholders gain clarity around how these models drive real-world value and can oversee performance easily.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W20,,,"Ophelia helps people quit opioids without going to rehab. We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, Ophelia is on a mission to provide effective, discreet treatment for opioid addiction right from the comfort of home. With over 3 million Americans struggling with opioid addiction—yet 80% not seeking help due to logistical and privacy concerns—Ophelia is stepping in to bridge that gap. Founded by Zack after the tragic loss of his girlfriend to an overdose, the company aims to make recovery more accessible through telemedicine.

#### What They Offer
Ophelia offers a comprehensive treatment protocol for opioid addiction which is *six times* more effective than traditional rehab facilities, many of which lack proper medical oversight. They combine medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with ongoing support—all served through virtual appointments. MAT integrates medication like Suboxone (buprenorphine + naloxone) with therapy, boasting a survival rate increase of up to 600%. 

#### The Problem They Address
The opioid crisis is stark. Every 11 minutes, an American dies from an overdose, making opioids the leading cause of death for individuals under 50. Traditional treatments often require patients to navigate uncomfortable environments, which can deter many from seeking help. Ophelia's model emphasizes a *consumer-first* approach by delivering treatment that is low-cost, confidential, and easy to access.

#### Their Impact
Operating from New York with a team of 130, Ophelia currently treats around 400 patients, with a waiting list eager for their service. The company taps into a $15 billion opioid treatment market, of which 85% of potential patients have insurance that can cover their costs. Most patients end up spending less than $10 a month for comprehensive care, including video consultations and medication management. 

#### The Vision Ahead
Backed by Michael Seibel from Y Combinator and fueled by their own stories of loss and resilience, Ophelia is actively raising funds to expand their capacity and reach. They’re dedicated to saving lives while providing a worthwhile opportunity for investors looking at venture-level returns. 

Don't let the stigma surrounding addiction hinder you or your loved ones—Ophelia is here to help. Their streamlined process ensures you can begin treatment in just a few steps, all while receiving compassionate, judgment-free support.

Individuals and corporations to claim back their value-added tax globally.",2019.0,[],"**Company Overview: Revenir**

**Founded:** 2019  
**Location:** London, United Kingdom  
**Team Size:** 11 employees  
**Batch:** Y Combinator W20  
**Website:** [revenir.ai](https://www.revenir.ai)  
**Focus Areas:** Fintech, SaaS, Travel  

**Mission:**  
Revenir aims to be the first API solution for tax returns, simplifying the VAT refund process for individuals and corporations globally.

---

**The Story Behind Revenir:**

Revenir began with a simple yet powerful idea: ""Your free money back to you with the trust of your own bank."" This vision drives their mission to help people reclaim the value-added tax (VAT) on purchases made abroad. It's astonishing how much VAT goes unclaimed—around 80%—and Revenir is here to change that.

**How They Do It:**

By automating tax recovery processes through partnerships with banks, Revenir eliminates the cumbersome, paperwork-heavy process typically associated with VAT refunds. Instead, customers simply upload a picture of their receipts through their banking app, and Revenir takes care of the rest. You'll receive your VAT reclaim back in your account—often within just 48 hours—without having to queue at an airport or fill out confusing forms.

**Who They Work With:**

Revenir collaborates with various financial institutions, allowing them to offer these VAT reclaim services to their customers seamlessly. Their white-label solutions empower banks and card providers to integrate this functionality via APIs, enhancing customer experience and potentially generating additional revenue streams.

**Cutting-Edge Technology:**

At the heart of Revenir’s platform are advanced technologies like machine learning and optical recognition. These help automatically identify eligible purchases, streamline the claim process, and ensure users never miss out on what they're owed. Revenir’s architecture utilizes AWS for robust and sustainable operations, reflecting their commitment to both innovation and environmental responsibility.

**Sustainability Efforts:**

Revenir takes sustainability seriously. They’ve reduced paper waste by eliminating reliance on physical receipts and forms. In partnership with Ecologi, they plant a tree for every ten VAT reclaims processed, contributing to global reforestation efforts. Their operations are powered by renewable energy sources, further reducing their carbon footprint.

**The Revenir Advantage:**

With Revenir, you can say goodbye to the headaches of traditional VAT reclaim processes. No waiting in long lines or enduring confusing forms. Just easy, integrated solutions that let you focus on enjoying your travels, all while ensuring you get the VAT refunds you deserve.

In a nutshell, Revenir isn’t just about reclaiming taxes; it’s about transforming the user experience through technology and sustainability.

Their mission? To revolutionize the cleanliness of commercial bathrooms using autonomous bathroom cleaning robots. Based in [N/A], SOMATIC employs a team of 31 talented individuals who are dedicated to this innovative task.

Now, let’s talk about what these robots actually do. The SOMATIC cleaning robots are equipped with advanced technology that allows them to autonomously spray cleaning solutions, vacuum up debris with a built-in wetvac, and even handle the rather mundane task of opening doors. The result is a consistent and high-quality cleaning solution, particularly beneficial for high-traffic areas that demand meticulous upkeep. 

The value proposition is striking: a cleaner, healthier environment for users and a significant reduction in labor costs. SOMATIC suggests that their technology can lead to up to 50% in cost savings and helps reduce staff turnover by providing a steady, reliable workforce for cleaning teams. 

In terms of practicality, they offer a simple pricing structure that scales based on service hours, from $1,500 for 8 hours on weekdays to $4,500 for 16 hours every day. Notably, there's no upfront fee, making it easier for businesses to incorporate this technology quickly.

It appears SOMATIC is addressing a real need in the cleaning industry while leveraging the latest robotics to raise the bar for hygiene in public facilities. With their commitment to efficiency and quality, they could redefine how we think about commercial cleaning.

Potentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. 

More interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.

Spenny is redefining how millennials in India approach investing. Founded in Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch, Spenny’s mission—dubbed ""Acorns for India""—is simple yet powerful: every time you make a digital transaction, Spenny rounds up your expenditure to the nearest 10 INR and automatically invests that spare change into a diversified portfolio. 

This automated investment model targets the staggering 400 million Indian millennials who typically shy away from investing, citing reasons like lack of time, knowledge, and capital. With Spenny, all you need to do is connect your card, and every swipe could potentially grow your wealth.

Since launching, Spenny has been making impressive strides, achieving a growth rate of 67% week-over-week, amassing over 3,000 users and $15,000 in assets under management (AUM). The opportunity is massive—Indians collectively deposit $500 billion into their bank accounts every year, and Spenny capitalizes on this with a modest fee of 1.75% of AUM, translating to an estimated $9 billion market niche within India.

The timing for Spenny is also fortuitous, with over 1 trillion expected transactions in 2021 alone. Factors such as WhatsApp's introduction of P2P payments and the widespread adoption of UPI have effectively furnished every Indian with access to a virtual bank account, creating fertile ground for Spenny's operations.

Moreover, Spenny's revenue model isn't solely reliant on transaction fees. The company leverages user transaction data to broaden their offerings, potentially upselling financial products like insurance and forging partnerships for brand loyalty programs. This dual revenue stream not only enhances customer engagement but also broadens the financial ecosystem Spenny operates within.

Customer acquisition is streamlined through strategic partnerships with banks, effectively tapping into their existing user bases by integrating Spenny's services into their mobile apps, while simultaneously investing capital into their mutual funds.

Looking ahead, Spenny aims to evolve into a comprehensive asset management solution tailored for millennials, providing all the financial tools they need at their fingertips.

Founded by Aanand Srinivas, former learning head at Khan Academy, and backed by curriculum advisor Dr. Brian Johnsrud from Stanford, this Bengaluru-based startup aims to transform how children aged 7 to 12 learn.

Forget the traditional classroom model; StayQrious combines personalized education with interactive activities, akin to a workout regime but for academic subjects. Students log in for sessions where they engage with interactive videos, provide feedback to peers, create explainer videos, and receive continuous, tailored feedback from coaches. This method emphasizes deep understanding before moving on to new concepts.

By focusing on real-world skills, the curriculum allocates substantial time for emotional intelligence, social skills, and independent learning. The classes, typically involving small groups of 8 students led by two coaches—a senior and a junior—are designed to mimic a workplace environment, enhancing collaboration and problem-solving skills.

StayQrious stands out by rejecting rote learning and conventional schooling pains. Instead, it ensures that kids actively engage with their education, working on projects like creating an investor pitch for a chocolate business or simulating historical figures to learn about evolution—all while being mindful of their mental health through regular check-ins and consultations with trained psychologists.

With a team of 29 and part of Y Combinator's W20 cohort, StayQrious is poised to cultivate a new generation of learners equipped for the complexities of the modern workforce.

Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's W20 batch, StratumAI is a Toronto-based company aimed at transforming the mining industry with innovative artificial intelligence solutions. Their mission is straightforward: to help mining companies pinpoint the most profitable drilling locations, thereby maximizing their returns.

#### The Problem with Traditional Mining Approaches

Traditionally, mining companies rely on narrow drillholes to assess the presence of gold and other valuable minerals. This method can be costly and time-consuming. Most companies use statistical interpolation to estimate the quantity of resources between these holes, which can lead to unpredictable results. 

StratumAI replaces these antiquated methods with sophisticated deep learning algorithms, resulting in more accurate predictions regarding both the best drilling locations and the quantities of minerals available. While the primary focus has been on gold, Stratum's technology has also been effective with other metals, including copper.

#### Tangible Value Creation

The company's innovative approach has shown potential to generate around $10 million in annual value for the average mine through enhanced operational efficiencies. They accomplish this by creating detailed models that improve mine planning and grade control via machine learning.

#### Key Benefits of StratumAI’s Solutions:

1. **Increased Average Ore Grade**: StratumAI can distinguish better between ore and waste, which allows for more refined extraction processes, enhancing the overall average grade of mined materials.
  
2. **Improved Mine Planning**: Their AI-driven models ensure that extraction efforts focus on economically viable areas, optimizing resource allocation and reducing waste.

3. **Real-time Tracking and Corrections**: StratumAI’s systems facilitate dynamic reconciliation of ore tracking, making adjustments easier and faster in the face of operational challenges such as dilution or miscalculations.

4. **Enhanced Drilling Efficiency**: With more effective drill targeting enabled by their AI, companies can extract more useful data per drillhole, accelerating resource development.

#### The Team and Vision

StratumAI manages a lean team of five dedicated employees, collaborating closely with partner Nan, to execute their ambitious vision for the future of mining. The focus is decidedly on leveraging AI to create a low-risk, high-yield mining environment. 

If you're interested in a future where mining is smarter, more efficient, and less wasteful, you might want to keep an eye on StratumAI as they continue to innovate and disrupt traditional practices in the industry.

**Overview:**  
Tajir is a groundbreaking company based in Lahore, Pakistan, founded in 2019 as part of Y Combinator’s W20 batch. Its mission? To empower mom-and-pop retail stores across the country by streamlining their inventory purchasing process. It's designed to be a one-stop-shop for store owners tired of the chaos that comes with juggling multiple suppliers.

**The Problem:**  
In Pakistan, small retail stores often face significant hurdles when sourcing inventory.

This inefficiency can be crippling, especially for the backbone of the economy—these small shops.

**The Solution:**  
Tajir offers a comprehensive platform that simplifies this arduous process. With a vast selection of products available at competitive prices, store owners can place orders 24/7 and enjoy next-day delivery. No more waiting around for salesmen or dealing with last-minute price changes. Tajir ensures transparency and speed, offering a user experience that feels modern and efficient.

**Key Features:**  
- **24/7 Ordering:** Store owners can place orders at their convenience without the limitations of supplier schedules.
- **Next-Day Delivery:** Instead of waiting days or longer for essential inventory, stores receive their orders promptly.
- **Transparent Pricing:** Real-time updates mean stores always know current prices, facilitating better comparison and decision-making.

**Why It Matters:**  
Mom-and-pop stores are crucial not just to local communities, but to Pakistan's larger economy. By enhancing their access to inventory and providing first-class logistics and pricing transparency, Tajir is effectively refactoring and simplifying the retail economy. It's a service that not only supports these retailers but also strengthens the entire market.

**Affiliation and Team:**  
With a diverse team of 50 employees, Tajir is led by a group that understands the nuances of the retail landscape in Pakistan, with support from partners like Nan.

**Growth and Recognition:**  
Tajir is gaining traction and attention, having been featured in notable publications and receiving investments, including a considerable $17 million Series A round led by Kleiner Perkins. It’s quickly becoming a trusted resource for hundreds of both local and multinational brands.

**Final Note:**  
For anyone involved in retail or interested in the evolving landscape of B2B marketplaces, Tajir represents a compelling case study.

Teleo is a pioneering company founded in 2019, nestled in Palo Alto and part of Y Combinator's W20 batch. Their mission is simple yet ambitious: to transform heavy equipment—think dozers, trucks, and loaders—into supervised autonomous machines. This innovation allows a single operator to manage multiple machines from a remote control center, opening the door to breathtaking productivity gains for general contractors. 

Why does this matter? The construction industry has long struggled with labor shortages and safety concerns. Teleo's approach not only modernizes operations but also enhances the overall working environment. Their remote command center offers safer, more comfortable conditions for operators, ultimately making these jobs more appealing and accessible.

**The Full Stack Solution**
Teleo offers a holistic platform, which features:
- A **Robust Mesh Network** for seamless connectivity.
- A **Universal Retrofit Kit** that facilitates adaptation of existing heavy equipment.
- A **Remote Command Center**, enabling operators to work from a secure location.
- **Proprietary Software** to manage and analyze operations effectively.

The results speak for themselves: companies using Teleo’s technology report significant boosts in productivity as one operator can now efficiently supervise several machines instead of one. There's also increased operational visibility thanks to real-time data analytics, which empower better decision-making.

**Client Testimonials**
Teleo is already making waves globally, with success stories from North America to Europe and even Australia. Clients like Scott Lyons from Tomahawk Construction highlight that Teleo’s technology can get idle equipment back into action, ultimately running a more efficient operation. Meanwhile, Ryan Aarts from John Aarts Group underscores the importance of safety, noting that a more secure setup allows a wider range of people to participate in the industry.

**Growing Recognition**
Success has not gone unnoticed. Teleo has made headlines for its innovative approaches, with features on Fox Business and Equipment World, and has garnered accolades like the Bay Area Inno Award for being one of the nine startups poised to change the world.

In a nutshell, Teleo is not just about enhancing construction efficiency; it’s about rethinking how heavy machinery is operated in a safer, smarter, and more productive way. As they increasingly embed their solutions into the very fabric of construction operations, they stand to disrupt an industry that has remained largely unchanged for decades.

Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's W20 batch, Vori is on a mission to level the playing field for independent and regional grocers against their larger competitors. Based in East Palo Alto, CA, with a dedicated team of 29 employees, Vori has developed a comprehensive modern operating system—VoriOS—aimed specifically at the grocery industry.

**What Is VoriOS?**

VoriOS streamlines the core operations of a grocery store, including inventory management, ordering, and supplier coordination. By integrating real-time data, it empowers grocers to optimize stock replenishment and pricing strategies, enabling them to operate more efficiently and profitably. 

The platform features several critical components:

- **Price Changes Management**: Automated systems that enhance profitability by ensuring accurate shelf pricing and reducing labor errors.
- **Shopper Engagement**: Features designed to understand customer buying habits and boost foot traffic through effective marketing and loyalty programs.

**Real Impact and Feedback**

Users across the country—from the bustling streets of Brooklyn to local markets in the Bay Area—report significant improvements in efficiency. For instance, grocers have noted faster checkout lines and enhanced customer experiences, which translates into happier customers and, ultimately, more sales. 

Vori is led by Michael Seibel as Group Partner, and its commitment to using technology to empower smaller retailers is evident throughout its innovative platform.

Founded in 2020 and rooted in San Francisco, Welcome is a trailblazer in creating virtual events that elicit a wow factor on par with an Apple Keynote. This vision brought Welcome into the spotlight as part of Y Combinator's W20 batch, and since then, it has grown to a dedicated team of around 50 employees.

At its core, Welcome's mission is to enable marketers and organizations to craft jaw-dropping virtual experiences. The company’s platform is designed to not only host webinars but to also enhance them through seamless integration and repurposing of content—effectively turning a single webinar into multiple assets that can drive engagement and reach.

The platform boasts an array of features such as **Welcome Studio, Create & Integrate**, and **Content Creator**, which leverages AI to transform recorded webinars into shareable video clips. Think of it as not just a webinar tool but a comprehensive solution for managing every aspect of virtual events—from registration to follow-up content.

**Why Welcome Stands Out:**
- **Engagement**: Welcome focuses on delivering experiences that attendees will remember. Users praise the platform for its intuitiveness and how it facilitates interaction during events—vital for keeping attendees engaged.
- **Value in Repurposing**: The Content Creator feature sets Welcome apart, enabling marketers to extract the most value from webinars by generating on-demand video content that can be utilized across social media and marketing strategies.
- **Community Impact**: With success stories showcasing growth from hundreds to tens of thousands of registrants, Welcome is changing the game for companies looking to enhance their event strategies.
