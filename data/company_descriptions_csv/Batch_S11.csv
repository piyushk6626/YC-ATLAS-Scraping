AgileMD, founded in 2011 and a proud member of Y Combinator Batch S11, is spearheading a transformation in healthcare. Based in the bustling heart of San Francisco, AgileMD has built a sophisticated cloud-based platform that leverages predictive analytics and clinical algorithms to support healthcare professionals across the United States. Their mission is clear: to enhance hospital care by ensuring patients receive optimal and timely treatment, grounded in the latest medical knowledge.

What does AgileMD actually do? Think of it as a safety net for clinical teams. Their flagship product, **eCART™**, serves as a clinical deterioration early warning system. It harnesses FDA-cleared AI to flag high-risk patients, thereby helping healthcare workers prioritize and escalate care when it matters most. This isn’t just theoretical; the system has been developed through a decade of research, analyzing over 3 million patient encounters across numerous health systems. The result? Reduced mortality rates and shorter hospital stays.

But it's not just about prevention. AgileMD also provides **Clinical Pathways**, which seamlessly integrate with existing Electronic Health Records (EHR). This feature enables clinicians to access updated protocols directly within their workflows, thus minimizing clinical variation and ensuring consistent, high-quality care. With more than 4,000 clinical pathways live across 250 hospitals, AgileMD is making evidence-based practices not just a goal but a reality.

With a dedicated team of 15 employees, AgileMD operates with a nimbleness that allows for rapid deployment of solutions, often within days to weeks rather than months. Their commitment to combining clinical decision support with EHR systems means that healthcare professionals can spend less time wrestling with technology and more time caring for patients. They've earned their credibility too, with over 80 peer-reviewed publications backing their clinical data and methodologies.

As you think about healthcare innovation, AgileMD exemplifies how technology can make an impactful change in patient care. If you’re hungry for better outcomes and less clinical burden, their approach might just be the solution you've been looking for.

Initially launched as Apollo GraphQL, they've quickly become a key player in both open-source and commercial GraphQL technologies. With a robust combination of tools—the Apollo Client, Server, and Gateway—their technology is downloaded over 17 million times a month, and it's trusted by a whopping 30% of the Fortune 500 companies including giants like Walmart and PayPal.

Founded in 2012 and backed by a powerhouse cast of investors like Insight Partners, Y Combinator, and Andreessen Horowitz, Apollo is headquartered in San Francisco and currently boasts a dynamic team of 200 employees. They're not just another tech tool; they're a partner in the development process, assisting teams in building and scaling their APIs efficiently.

Their suite of products focuses on three foundational pillars:

1. **Faster Development**: The Apollo GraphOS platform allows backend teams to create a self-service, self-documenting graph. This architecture reduces boilerplate code and allows teams to deliver updates faster. In practical terms, it means that once a developer defines data semantics, it can deliver across various applications seamlessly.

2. **Improved Collaboration**: Apollo fosters better collaboration among backend teams by providing a centralized registry and standardized workflows. This means less friction when teams need to work together, helping developers to focus on what truly matters—building features!

3. **Performance Optimization**: By reducing unnecessary latency and allowing frontend teams to fetch all required data in a single request, Apollo helps in optimizing the performance of applications. They even offer GraphQL-native metrics through GraphOS for quick diagnosis of any performance issues.

Their customers' feedback speaks volumes. Leaders from Booking.com, Netflix, and many more have testified to the transformational impact Apollo’s solutions have had on their engineering processes. For instance, Rick Fast from Expedia praised their unified approach, stating that it allowed them to rebuild their entire trips experience three times faster than their previous methods.

Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, ""fake news"", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.

By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies.
