Founded in 2010 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch S10, the Recurse Center (RC) is a unique educational retreat in New York City designed specifically for programmers seeking to hone their skills. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting out, RC invites you to recharge, grow, and work on projects that ignite your curiosity. 

### The Concept
At its core, Recurse Center operates on a simple but powerful premise: learning is personal and self-directed. The retreat spans six to twelve weeks, during which participants immerse themselves in coding—without the pressures of deadlines, grades, or performance metrics (think of it as a coding sabbatical). With a friendly environment and no formal curriculum, it allows developers from various backgrounds to collaborate, share insights, and support one another.

### Cost and Support
Remarkably, RC is free for all participants. This is possible because they run an integrated recruiting agency that offers optional personalized job placement services. This approach not only removes financial barriers but also fosters a community of cooperation rather than competition.

### Community and Connection
Currently, the Recurse Center has a dedicated team of about ten employees and a vast network of over 2,600 alumni—each adding to the rich tapestry of support and collaboration. Participants benefit from 24/7 access to RC's Brooklyn hub, enabling them to work in a quiet and inspiring space or connect with peers from around the world.

### Career Perks
The Recurse Center is also a strategic stepping stone for those seeking new opportunities post-retreat. The Career Services team takes a personal approach, matching participants with companies and roles that align with their goals and values. Additionally, friendly alumni are on hand to provide mock interview practice, enhancing the chances of landing a job that fits.

### A Commitment to Diversity
RC is especially committed to inclusivity and has invested over $1.7 million in living expense grants to underrepresented groups in tech. They have worked hard to create a welcoming atmosphere where everyone can thrive, regardless of their background.

### In Their Words
Participants have echoed their experiences, calling RC a ""magical place"" and a ""transformational"" retreat for both personal and professional development. As Andrew Kelley, creator of Zig, stated: “It’s rare to find such dedicated people who genuinely believe in a cause.”
