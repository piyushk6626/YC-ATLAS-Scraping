Your right to privacy - freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into your personal and private affairs.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a stalwart defender of rights and liberties in the United States. Founded in 1920, it began as a small group of civil liberties activists and has grown into a powerhouse, boasting over 500,000 members and supporters nationwide. With a dedicated team of about 1,700 employees, the ACLU operates from almost every state, tackling approximately 6,000 court cases annually.

### Mission and Purpose

The ACLU’s mission is straightforward yet profound: to preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to all people by the U.S. Constitution and laws. This nonprofit, nonpartisan organization strives to protect a broad array of rights, including:

- **First Amendment Rights:** Protecting freedoms related to speech, assembly, press, and religion.
- **Equal Protection:** Fighting against unlawful discrimination.
- **Due Process:** Ensuring fair treatment in legal proceedings.
- **Privacy Rights:** Defending individuals from unwarranted government intrusions.

Moreover, the ACLU is dedicated to fighting for marginalized groups who have historically faced rights denials, including people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.

### Funding and Affiliation

Uniquely positioned among organizations of its ilk, the ACLU does not accept government funding. It relies entirely on membership dues, private contributions, and grants from foundations and individuals, which empowers it to advocate independently and vigorously.

### Notable Issues and Initiatives

The ACLU actively engages in various social justice issues such as:

- **Reproductive Freedom:** Advocating for the right to make personal health decisions.
- **Racial Justice:** Addressing systemic inequalities and discriminatory practices.
- **Voting Rights:** Protecting access to the ballot box for all citizens.
- **Transgender Rights:** Championing the rights and dignity of transgender individuals.

In the face of ongoing threats to civil liberties, the ACLU's action is more critical than ever. They engage with communities, lobby for legislative changes, and fight in court whenever rights are violated.

### Historical Impact

The ACLU has a storied history as a pioneer in civil rights advocacy. Over the decades, its legal battles have significantly influenced American law and society. Key milestones include:

- **Defending Japanese Americans** during their internment in WWII.
- Winning the landmark **Loving v. Virginia** case which overturned bans on interracial marriage.
- Advocating for **same-sex marriage rights** in the landmark case of Obergefell v. Hodges.

### Get Involved

Anyone looking to support civil liberties can join the ACLU through donations or volunteer opportunities. They encourage grassroots activism through their People Power platform, allowing individuals to partake in various advocacy efforts.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W17,,,"We’re on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",2015.0,[],"### Bountiful: Redefining Agricultural Efficiency 

Founded in 2015 and hailing from the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area, Bountiful is on a mission to revolutionize the agricultural industry with its innovative approach—a robust operating system for farmers. Before Bountiful came onto the scene, predicting crop yields was fraught with inaccuracies; the grape yield prediction error rate was a staggering 30%. Many farmers, particularly in the specialty crops sector, relied on outdated methods like pencil and paper, which delayed critical insights and led to significant waste and inefficiency.

Seeing this as a problem ripe for innovation, the founders set out to harness the power of advanced data science. They developed a platform that integrates machine learning with a plethora of data sources—weather patterns, satellite imagery, geographical factors, and historical trends—allowing farmers to forecast their yields with remarkable accuracy. Today, Bountiful boasts a 95% accuracy rate in predicting yields for specialty crops, and its insights are causing ripples of positive change across the agricultural value chain.

Bountiful offers a suite of solutions including:

- **Bountiful OS**: This is their core operating system designed to consolidate critical farming data—from production and quality metrics to costs and forecasting—into a single platform, streamlining operations for farmers.
  
- **Bountiful Agriculture**: Farmers receive ongoing, data-driven yield forecasts that adapt throughout the growth season, transforming farming decisions.
  
- **Bountiful Market**: A marketplace connecting farmers with the latest market insights and trends, helping them make informed decisions about what to plant and sell.

As part of Y Combinator’s Batch W17, Bountiful is backed by a seasoned group of experts and has successfully grown to a tight-knit team of four passionate employees. They don't just focus on enhancing individual farms; their broader vision aims to optimize the entire global food supply chain.

The company is proactive in the AI space as well, having recently released an AI assistant to help patients better understand and handle their medical bills.

### Impact and Reach
Collectly is not just a tool; it’s a game-changer. Their solutions have been shown to enable healthcare providers to collect payments up to 300% faster compared to industry averages. With more than 3,000 facilities using Collectly, they’ve reported patient payments getting processed within 1-2 weeks instead of the typical 60-90 days.

### Team and Leadership
Collectly boasts a diverse team of 89 employees, led by their Group Partner, Michael Seibel from Y Combinator. This experienced workforce is committed to changing how healthcare organizations manage their billing and collections processes.

### Why It Matters

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W17,,,"At Extern, we’re solving the experience gap.  Extern created the remote Externship, a skill-building work experience that is easier for students to access, and easier for companies to run, than an internship.  Our mission is to help anyone discover and launch their career through professional experiences available anywhere at any time.  Since 2020, we’ve created and powered Externships on behalf of companies from Fortune 500s to startups that have enabled tens of thousands of students to build real experience and open doors to incredible opportunity.  

After spending $100K on average for a 4-year degree, graduates find that almost 40% of entry level jobs on Linkedin required 3+ years of work experience. Internships are how many college students get this kind of experience, but the demand for good internships outstrips the supply. Internship programs are difficult to scale, they favor students who already have social capital, and they’re time-consuming for employers to run.

Externships are short, online, project-based work experiences that employers can offer to hundreds of students using less resource and employee time than it would take to support an intern.  Extern makes the complex process of running an Externship completely turnkey with software and industry experts which in turn makes professional experience more accessible to more students.

By making work experience more accessible, Extern is driving the rapid mobility and upskilling needed for a new economy.  We envision a world where anyone can access work experience as a form of education – no matter their background, experience, or socio-economic status.  Come join our movement to reshape work, education, and credentialing for future generations with the Externship.

Extern was born out of a pivot from Paragon One (W17) which initially focused on providing students with a career center-as-a-service platform, connecting them with industry professionals to receive career coaching and guidance.

Founded in 2019 and based in New York, Extern is transforming the way students gain professional experience, leveling the playing field for aspiring professionals across various backgrounds. Imagine spending an average of $100,000 for a degree, only to find that many entry-level positions demand years of experience—it's a disheartening realization. Extern's mission is clear: *Professional Experience Anytime, Anywhere.* 

At its core, Extern is addressing a significant issue—what they term the ""experience gap."" The conventional path to gaining work experience, namely internships, is often inadequate. The number of students seeking these opportunities dwarfs the available slots, and the traditional internships frequently cater to those with existing advantages, like strong social networks. This has led to tens of thousands of students missing out on critical professional development.

Enter Externships: a modern, remote, project-based alternative to internships that offers meaningful professional experiences at scale. By leveraging advanced technology, Extern allows companies—ranging from Fortune 500 giants to agile startups—to manage these externships with ease. This flexibility makes it simpler for employers to connect with hundreds of students, without the extensive resources that traditional internships require.

Extern's approach not only democratizes access to work experience but also accelerates skill development in an ever-evolving economy. With a vision where everyone can secure work experience as an educational vehicle, Extern is leading the charge to reshape how we perceive work, education, and credentials for future generations.

Originally pivoting from an earlier initiative called Paragon One—focused on career coaching—Extern has garnered backing from notable investors such as Y Combinator and Foundation Capital. Today, the team of 35 is passionately implementing innovative externship programs that empower students to explore diverse career paths through real, impactful projects.

For just $10 a month, students can submit an application to access a multitude of externships, diving into fields ranging from marketing to product development. By participating, they gain hands-on experience, build essential skills, and connect with industry professionals—all while remaining flexible and remote.

Extern is clearly not just filling a gap; it's opening doors. With their innovative externship model, they’re changing the narrative for students who are eager to step into real-world roles and asking us all to reconsider what vital experience truly looks like in today’s job market.

They're honing in on mRNA advancements through first principles, which has slashed the time for experiments from months or years to mere weeks, cutting costs significantly from millions to thousands. The only constraint they face now? Scientific curiosity.

The culture at Helix Nano is equally compelling. They reject rigid hierarchies; the company thrives on the nimble ideas sprouting from all team members, including those at junior levels. A diverse team isn't just a checkbox for them; it's a catalyst for innovation, speeding up the discovery of groundbreaking ideas.

Currently, some of their projects in the pipeline include moving a COVID-19 vaccine candidate tailored for the immunocompromised toward clinical trials, and exploring interventions that could have a massive positive impact on the environment.

Helix Nanotechnologies is not just about science; it's about a vision for a better, healthier world where barriers are lowered, and scientific breakthroughs are more accessible. If you're as fascinated by the possibilities at the frontier of biotechnology as they are, you just might want to keep an eye on their progress.

Differently from marketplaces, we employ directly our cleaners, to foster retention and quality of service.",2015.0,[],"Hogaru is a tech-enabled home services platform based in Bogotá, Colombia, that’s carving a niche in Latin America’s cleaning and maintenance industry. Founded in 2015 and an alum of the Y Combinator W17 batch, Hogaru operates with a key differentiator: unlike other marketplace models, they directly employ their cleaning professionals. This approach fosters retention and ensures a higher quality of service, which can be a game changer in an industry often plagued by high turnover and inconsistent quality.

With a robust team of 746 employees, Hogaru provides cleaning services not only for homes but also for micro businesses. Their mission is simple yet compelling: to offer reliable and professional cleaning solutions that customers can trust.

### Services Offered
Hogaru’s offerings include routine home cleaning, employee onboarding for those looking to hire assistance, and contract management services for businesses. They emphasize customer satisfaction and actively seek feedback after every service, showcasing a commitment to improvement and customer experience.

### Why Hogaru Stands Out
Hogaru’s model is particularly notable for its focus on direct employment, which not only supports the workers with job stability and benefits but also gives customers peace of mind knowing their service is consistent and of high quality. Their efforts to maintain a positive work environment reflect in the feedback from both clients and employees, who often commend the professionalism and dedication of the staff.

### The Bigger Picture
Operating in a market that’s ripe for disruption, Hogaru aligns itself with powerful tech trends and the growing demand for home services, particularly in urban areas. As Latin America continues to experience significant growth in the tech and service sectors, platforms like Hogaru stand as testament to the value of blending technology with traditional service jobs—creating better work conditions, enhancing service quality, and ensuring customer satisfaction.

With a lean team of seven, Loop is effectively carving out a niche in the recruiting landscape by replacing traditional hiring metrics with more reliable, performance-based assessments. 

**What They Do:**

Loop Support develops pre-employment assessments designed to simulate the real work scenarios that job applicants will face on the job.

This interactive assessment gauges critical skills like communication, problem-solving, speed, and aptitude by placing candidates in real-life support contexts. 

Their process is laid out in three primary steps:
1. **Pre-vetting**: Candidates are assessed through simulations that reflect actual job conditions rather than just their past experiences.
2. **Matching**: The system intelligently parses the candidates' backgrounds, highlighting transferable skills tailored to the hiring company's specific needs.
3. **Interviews**: Loop facilitates efficient interviews by allowing recruiters to view personal candidate statements and book interviews with the top matches seamlessly integrating with existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

**Key Metrics:**
- **77%** faster time-to-hire compared to traditional methods.
- **5x** increase in final screen pass rates.
- **97%** candidate satisfaction reflects their focus on creating a positive hiring experience. 
- Over **136,000 assessments** have been graded through their platform, demonstrating ongoing trust from over 100 client companies.

**Catering to the Candidate Experience:**
Loop places a strong emphasis on ensuring candidates have a positive experience during assessments. Many users express enjoyment with the assessment process, finding it engaging and reflective of real-world challenges they'll face if hired. This focus on a streamlined, candidate-friendly journey helps attract top talent, enhancing the companies’ appeal in a competitive job market.

Founded in 2015 and hailing from the vibrant technology hub of Los Angeles, Nuvola, initially known as Millibatt, is on a mission to transform the battery landscape—specifically for IoT devices. Their focus? Developing 10x power coin batteries that ensure reliable connectivity for a myriad of applications, from trackers and earbuds to health monitors. 

### A New Approach to Coin Batteries

Nuvola offers a compelling solution for hardware designers: custom high-power rechargeable coin batteries tailored to meet specific design needs. With an impressively low minimum order quantity of just 10 units, Nuvola allows designers to experiment and iterate rapidly, ensuring they find the ideal power compatibility for their products. This adaptability is crucial in a fast-paced market where speed can be the difference between success and mediocrity.

### Innovations: SafeCoat™ and Nimbus™ Technologies

At the heart of Nuvola's approach are two innovative technologies:
1. **SafeCoat™ DDS (Direct Deposition Separator)**: This groundbreaking battery separator eliminates common manufacturing defects that lead to thermal runaway—a notorious cause of battery fires. SafeCoat not only enhances safety but also boosts energy density by up to 20%, all while being cost-competitive with traditional materials.

2. **Nimbus™ ZEA (Z-Fold Electrode Architecture)**: Designed to significantly extend battery life, particularly for small wireless applications, Nimbus replaces conventional coiled electrodes with a compact Z-Fold structure. This advancement allows batteries to last up to 16 times longer, a remarkable achievement for devices like True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds and sophisticated health tracking sensors.

### Lean Team, Big Aspirations

With a nimble team of four employees and backing from Y Combinator's W17 batch, Nuvola is poised to disrupt the alternative battery sector. Their partnership with Nan enhances their strategic capabilities, positioning them well within a competitive industry landscape marked by a strong push for sustainable energy solutions.

### Conclusion

In a world increasingly dependent on connectivity, Nuvola is not just creating batteries; they’re establishing the backbone for a range of essential technologies. Their commitment to safety, performance, and customization resonates deeply in a market clamoring for innovation. As IoT devices proliferate, companies like Nuvola will be at the forefront, ensuring that these devices power our connected lives reliably and efficiently.

Its purpose is to help you figure out how you can do the most good. It will help you think about which cause to focus on and how to use your money or your time to start making a difference, right away.",,[],"The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) is a non-profit organization based in Oxford, UK, that operates in the realm of effective altruism—a philosophy and social movement that promotes using evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to help others. The CEA's mission is simple yet profound: to help you maximize the impact of your charitable efforts, whether through time or financial contributions.

The organization emerged from the effective altruism movement, which emphasizes the importance of evaluating charitable interventions based on their effectiveness. This approach isn’t just about recommending a charity but getting you to think critically about which causes are most worthy of your support. The goal? To make giving not just an act of kindness, but a strategic effort to make the world a better place, effectively and efficiently.

Founded in Y Combinator's W17 batch, the Centre for Effective Altruism currently has a lean team of 15 dedicated to various initiatives within this philosophy. The work includes facilitating a rich tapestry of educational resources—from introductory seminars and online courses to a wealth of articles, podcasts, and books geared toward empowering individuals to do more with their careers and charitable donations.

Among their notable projects and initiatives is the ""80,000 Hours"" program, which emphasizes the importance of your career in maximizing your positive impact. They also provide charity recommendations through the ""Giving What We Can"" community, striving to connect donors with high-impact organizations. 

The effective altruism community isn't just a singular entity; it encapsulates a diverse network of individuals and organizations globally, working collaboratively to address the world's pressing problems—ranging from global poverty to existential risks posed by emerging technologies.
