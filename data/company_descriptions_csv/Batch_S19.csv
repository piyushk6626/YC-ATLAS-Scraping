Apero Health, founded in 2019 and proudly backed by Y Combinator (Batch S19), is a San Francisco-based startup that’s aiming to rewire how medical billing is done. With the mission of bringing “modern medical billing” to healthcare practices, Apero promises a future where transparency and simplicity reign supreme in the often convoluted world of healthcare finance.

### Who They Are

Apero began with a straightforward idea: to help healthcare companies run their practices more efficiently. Now, they've expanded to integrate critical services like eligibility checks, business intelligence insights, claims processing, and managing patient payments. The founding team consists of graduates from elite institutions like Stanford and Berkeley, including the former CTO of Doctor on Demand, bringing invaluable experience in scaling health tech platforms.

Their credibility is backed by an impressive roster of investors, including Paul Buchheit, creator of Gmail, and founders from notable tech companies like Gusto and Reddit. Today, Apero has grown to a nimble team of 24 industriously pursuing their vision across practices nationwide.

### What They Do

Apero offers a **comprehensive platform** that packs everything care providers need to manage and grow their practices into a modular and intuitive interface. Think of it as your all-in-one toolkit for healthcare operations, featuring:

- Scheduling and visit notes
- Revenue cycle management (RCM)

### Integration and Trust

Apero seamlessly integrates with leading Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, ensuring that practices can hook up their operations without a hitch. And rest assured, they haven’t skimped on security – their architecture is fully HIPAA compliant, encrypted, and carries SOC I and SOC II Type 2 certifications. 

Their approach to security has stemmed from founders with extensive backgrounds, including the National Security Agency, ensuring that your data is safeguarded against the rising backdrop of cyber threats.

### Why It Matters

Apero is more than just software; they’re equipped to empower healthcare providers with the tools they need for transparent billing practices, drastically improving operational efficiency. From startups in the health space to established public companies, Apero is on a mission to redefine how healthcare billing is perceived and executed.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S19,,,"If we've learned anything in the last few years it's that spending time with our friends and family is essential to our well-being and happiness. Unfortunately, loud and noisy places like weddings and family gatherings hinder human connection, especially for the hearing impaired. In fact, the biggest unmet need in the entire hearing healthcare industry is hearing in noisy places. AudioFocus helps patients hear in these environments by only enhancing voices nearby the patients and ignoring ones farther away. We do this using acoustics informed machine learning and custom microphone array design.

Our goal is to increase the adoption rate of 37M US adults with hearing loss, only 8M use hearing aids today.

Founded by Auditory Neuroscientist & AI expert and a Hearing Aid hardware design expert.",2019.0,"[{'name': 'Shariq Mobin, Founder', 'description': 'Machine Learning and Distributed Systems hacker. Accessibility advocate.', 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/shariqmobin'}]","Let's talk about AudioFocus, a company tackling one of the most pervasive challenges in hearing healthcare: noise. Founded in 2019 and based in Oakland, CA, AudioFocus emerged from a deep understanding of how vital it is for people, especially those with hearing loss, to connect in lively environments—think family gatherings or bustling cafes. Unfortunately, traditional hearing aids often amplify not just the voices we want to hear but also the surrounding noise, making these situations even more frustrating.

The founders—a blend of auditory neuroscience and AI expertise—have developed a smart, machine-learning-powered solution that focuses solely on enhancing nearby voices while filtering out the rest. In essence, they’re bending sound to the user’s will, allowing them to engage in conversations even amid the chaos of background noise.

Their technology is a game-changer because it uses advanced algorithms and custom microphone arrays to analyze sound in real-time, mimicking how our brains filter out unwanted noise. This approach distinguishes them from existing hearing aids, which struggle in environments where multiple conversations happen simultaneously. By only amplifying critical voices based on their proximity, AudioFocus enables users to navigate social situations with ease and clarity.

AudioFocus is on a mission to address a considerable gap in the market—of the 37 million adults in the U.S. who have hearing loss, a mere 8 million use existing hearing aids. This shows there's a world of unmet needs out there, and AudioFocus is building a bridge to reach it. 

Currently, they’re a small team of four and are part of Y Combinator’s Batch S19, reflecting their potential for innovation and growth. They're tagged as focusing on deep learning, hardware, medical devices, and they have the technical chops to make a real impact.

If you’re curious to know more or get involved, check out their website at [audiofocus.io](http://audiofocus.io).

Dex helps turn your acquaintances into your allies.  Going beyond the superficiality of social networks requires commitment.  If you remember to keep in touch thoughtfully, you can turn the interesting person you met at a networking event into a friend that has your back.  

I built Dex after failing to keep up with the tools I tried (Airtable, Notion, etc) for relationship management. Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.

Dex is a lightweight personal CRM thatâs easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while youâre in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:

- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.
- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.
- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldnât otherwise remember.",2019.0,[],"**Dex: The Personal CRM for Meaningful Connections**

**Overview**
Founded in 2019 and hailing from San Francisco, Dex is a personal CRM designed to help you manage your relationships more effectively. It emerged out of the founder's struggle with existing tools—like Notion and Airtable—that never quite fit the informal nature of personal connections. With a lean team of 7 and backing from Y Combinator (Batch S19), Dex challenges the conventional view of customer relationship management by focusing on personal relationships rather than sales pipelines.

**Mission**
Dex aims to be more than just a reminder tool. Its mission is to turn acquaintances into allies by encouraging users to maintain thoughtful follow-ups, whether it's that interesting person you met at a networking event or old school friends. By making relationship management simple and contextual, Dex helps you stay connected with the people who matter.

**Features**
- **Lightweight CRM:** Dex simplifies your life by blending seamlessly into your daily workflow. A Chrome extension allows you to manage relationships while using popular apps like Facebook and Twitter.
- **Actionable Reminders:** It sends you nudges to follow up and log interactions, ensuring you never miss an opportunity to reconnect.
- **Relationship Building:** With Dex, you can build stronger relationships by remembering critical details about how you met, important dates, and more.

**Usability**
Unlike heavyweight CRM systems like HubSpot that feel clunky for personal use, Dex is designed for busy individuals. It integrates directly with platforms like LinkedIn and Gmail, ensuring your contacts are always updated without tedious data entry. 

**Security & Privacy**
Dex takes user privacy seriously, supporting its service through subscriptions—not ads. You’re in control of your data, with the ability to export or delete it anytime.

**Target Audience**
Dex appeals to busy professionals, students (especially MBA candidates), investors, and creators looking to deepen their networks without getting bogged down by complex systems.

**Current Status**
With over 30,000 users, Dex is steadily growing as the go-to tool for those seeking to enhance their professional and personal relationships. If you're intrigued and want to give it a spin, you can start for free at [getdex.com](https://getdex.com).

Founded in 2019 and a proud member of Y Combinator's S19 batch, Downtobid is a New York-based company that is revolutionizing the construction bidding process using artificial intelligence. Their mission is simple yet ambitious: to help general contractors (GCs) and trade contractors understand construction plans faster and more efficiently.

**What They Do**

Downtobid offers a suite of AI-driven tools designed specifically for the construction industry. Their products include:

- **ITB Tool for Commercial GCs**: This tool simplifies the process for GCs to automatically identify scopes of work, send personalized invitations to subcontractors, and ultimately streamline bid management.
- **Bid Board for Commercial Trade Contractors**: A platform that allows trade contractors to manage all their bid invitations, deadlines, and communications, centralizing everything in one dashboard without laborious manual data entry.

The focus is on connecting GCs with vetted subcontractors, ensuring that invitations go out quickly and effectively, while also allowing subcontractors to respond with ease.

**Why Downtobid Stands Out**

In a market where outdated tools can cost general contractors time and frustrate project timelines, Downtobid offers a compelling solution. Their platform has over 57,000 active subcontractor profiles, simplifying the search for reliable partners and targeting bids more effectively. With features like automated follow-ups and a contractor-friendly planroom, their tools not only increase efficiency but also foster better relationships in the bidding process.

Downtobid is particularly attractive for those looking to optimize their time and bidding results. They boast double the response rates on invitations—the kind of leverage any contractor would want. They even offer 95% trade coverage, making expansion into new markets less daunting.

**The Team and Vision**

Based in New York with a dedicated team of five, Downtobid is guided by strategic insights and a vision to reshape the bidding landscape. Their group partner, Nan, adds weight to their growth ambitions. 

**Success Stories and Future Prospects**

Successes are already rolling in. Contractors using Downtobid report significant time saved, enhanced bid management, and increased opportunities. For instance, George H. Pastor & Sons doubled their subcontractor responses and cut down administrative hours drastically by leveraging Downtobid's tools.

The future looks promising for Downtobid as they continue to disrupt and elevate the construction bidding landscape with more innovations on the horizon. Curious about how these tools work in practice? You can explore them further on their website: [Downtobid.com](https://downtobid.com).

Founded in 2019 and hailing from Y Combinator's S19 batch, Freshpaint operates in the heart of San Francisco with a dedicated team of around 75 employees. Their core mission? Ensuring that healthcare organizations can collect and activate customer data without compromising patient privacy, all while staying HIPAA compliant. 

**The Challenge**: Traditional web analytics and marketing tools often require sharing sensitive health information. That’s a big no-no in the healthcare space, where data privacy is paramount. 

**The Solution**: Freshpaint simplifies this landscape by acting as a robust data infrastructure. Their platform effectively facilitates the transfer of data—what we can term the ""hard part""—but it goes further by controlling the flow of sensitive HIPAA-regulated data to third-party marketing tools. It’s essential for healthcare marketing teams to thrive without the fears of regulatory breaches.

#### Key Features:
- **BAA-Supported Platform**: Freshpaint signs Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with healthcare organizations, ensuring that patient privacy is prioritized in every interaction. 
- **Safe by Default**: The platform blocks data to non-compliant tools automatically, which effectively reduces risks linked to human errors.
- **Anonymous Tracking**: By creating anonymous identifiers for visitors, Freshpaint lets organizations track customer journeys while still protecting privacy.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Supports integration with popular marketing tools like Google Analytics and advertising services, ensuring organizations can drive insights without compromising on compliance. 

#### Why It Matters:
With increasing privacy regulations and data breaches in the limelight, Freshpaint positions itself as not just a tool, but as a partner for healthcare marketers. They give organizations the ability to market effectively while avoiding pitfalls associated with data sharing. This balance is becoming increasingly crucial in a privacy-first world where patient trust is non-negotiable.

Jared Friedman, a Group Partner at Y Combinator, sums up its potential: Freshpaint enables healthcare providers to utilize digital marketing tools—previously seen as risky—effectively and safely.

We’re a small, friendly team based out of a state-of-the-art virtual office, where you can work whenever and wherever suits you. Come join us!

Since its inception in May 2020, Gather has established itself as a significant player in the realm of virtual interactions. Founded in San Francisco and an alumnus of Y Combinator's S19 batch, Gather is not just another video chat tool; it's a platform designed to humanize online meetings, making them more engaging and effective.

**The Mission**  
Gather's mission is simple yet profound: ""Building a better way to meet online."" This mission reflects a commitment to enhance connections for people everywhere—whether in professional settings, casual meet-ups, or educational discussions—by creating a unique, immersive experience reminiscent of real-world interactions. Think of it as creating a virtual layer over our physical world, an accessible Metaverse where work and play can seamlessly coexist.

**The Journey So Far**  
Gather has seen impressive growth since launch, bringing millions together virtually. With a team of around 60 talented individuals, the company has successfully raised $77 million in Series A and B funding, backed by major players like Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures. This solid financial foundation supports a vision of continuous innovation and enhancement of its platform.

**Why Gather Stands Out**  
Gather transforms traditional remote work dynamics by emphasizing proximity and visibility. It creates an environment where team members can communicate freely, pop by each other's 'desks,' and even engage in impromptu conversations—mimicking the natural flow of an in-person office. This approach is not just functional; it cultivates a sense of community and camaraderie among dispersed teams.

**Targeted Solutions**  
The platform’s offerings span various use cases including virtual offices, team meetings, and social gatherings. It’s particularly beneficial for remote work, education, and even virtual conferences. The plethora of integrations, such as Slack and Google, enhances its utility, allowing users to stay connected and productive without the hassle of switching between applications.

**User Testimonials**  
The feedback from Gather’s users underscores its impact. From CEOs to employees, users report an enhanced culture, better communication, and improved efficiency in their remote interactions. It's evident that Gather isn’t just a tool; it's become integral to how teams collaborate and thrive in diverse environments.

**In Conclusion**  
For anyone looking to redefine their online meeting experience and foster a genuine sense of connection among remote teams, Gather is an exceptional choice. Whether you’re a startup seeking to cultivate a vibrant workplace culture or an established firm looking for innovative solutions, Gather is ready to help you bridge the gaps that distance creates.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S19,,,"GEn1E Lifesciences is a Clinical-stage, multi-target company with a unique AI platform. We develop novel, next-generation, immunomodulatory therapies for rare & inflammatory diseases with no effective treatments. Our team is supercharging the drug development cycle by applying AI to multiple-mechanism-of-action protein targets and their natural platform capabilities—creating novel therapeutics at an unprecedented pace. Our AI platform has enabled us to develop a purpose-built therapy for ARDS to reduce its $20 billion cost on society (just in the USA). 

GEn1E has built a rich pipeline of 21+ novel and selective immunomodulators and has plans to accelerate 2 additional devastating diseases (beyond their lead indication) to IND in the next 12 months. Our AI platform enables tremendous pace and capital efficiency as demonstrated by our progress in ~2 years with seed capital—a stark contrast to the typical spend of $100M+ and 7+ years exhibited in the pharmaceuticals / biotech industry.

With ~90% of rare diseases having no therapeutic treatment at all, GEn1E is taking a giant swing that will hopefully bring life-saving therapies to the lives of patients in need.

The team at GEn1E has decades of experience in drug development and machine learning. We graduated from YCombinator and Stanford-StartX in late 2019. We are based in Palo Alto, CA.",2018.0,[],"GEn1E Lifesciences is an ambitious biotech startup that launched in 2018, born from the roundtable discussions of Y Combinator's S19 batch and fueled by a mission that's both noble and urgent: to accelerate the development of therapies for rare and inflammatory diseases through an innovative AI platform. Based in Palo Alto, California, GEn1E has quickly positioned itself as a clinical-stage, multi-target company that’s making waves in the drug discovery arena.

### The Mission 
At its core, GEn1E is dedicated to finding effective treatments for diseases that, as it stands, have none—an alarming statistic that applies to around 90% of rare diseases. Their focus on immunomodulatory therapies aims to change that narrative. By applying advanced AI technologies, GEn1E is not just speeding up the drug development process; it’s doing so with a brisk efficiency that shatters the norms of the industry, often characterized by $100 million budgets and 7-year timelines.

### The Technology 
GEn1E's proprietary AI platform, GRID™, stands out by harnessing a wealth of curated data that seamlessly interlinks genes, proteins, and disease pathways to identify promising therapeutic targets. This allows them to pinpoint new binding sites for drug development—an approach that has led them to identify 21+ first-in-class compounds and move at a dizzying pace from early discovery to Phase 2 clinical trials in just two and a half years. They’ve developed targeted therapies such as their ARDS-specific treatment, sharply aimed at reducing a staggering $20 billion societal cost in the U.S. alone.

### The Pipeline 
Currently, GEn1E boasts a pipeline with an impressive array of novel therapeutics. They have key programs targeting multiple inflammatory disease pathways using their cutting-edge p38α:MK2 Dual Signal Modulators, among other innovative compounds. In the next year, they plan to fast-track two additional disease targets toward Investigational New Drug (IND) application status.

### The Team 
Led by a seasoned team with extensive experience in drug development and machine learning, GEn1E combines expertise to bridge the gap between technology and therapeutic innovation. Their board recently welcomed François Nader, MD, further bolstering their strategic direction.

### Conclusion
GEn1E Lifesciences is not just another company in the healthcare space. It embodies a forward-thinking approach that leverages AI to tackle some of medicine's toughest challenges.

By harnessing a blend of AI models and a talented team of full-time engineers, GitStart manages everything from ticket scoping to peer reviews. This means you're only paying for the PRs that get merged, ensuring costs are tightly aligned with value.

With a compact team of 19, GitStart has already made a significant impact, handling over 15,000 PRs for various innovative companies like Cal.com and Firefox. Their service is designed to let engineering teams scale flexibly—adjusting the volume of work as needed without the overhead of traditional hiring. 

The process works like this:
1. **Assign:** You submit tickets, and their AI Ticket Studio creates well-defined tasks by referencing your codebase.
2. **Update:** Keep in the loop with real-time updates on ticket progress sent directly to your Slack.
3. **Review:** GitStart handles extensive QA and code review, allowing you to merge only after the highest standards of quality are met.

GitStart isn’t just about delivering PRs but about enabling companies to accelerate their development cycles while maintaining a lean operation. They emphasize security with a feature called GitSlice, which allows clients to share only the necessary portions of their codebase needed for the developers to complete tasks.

Founded in 2018 and a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch S19, Hatchways is a Toronto-based company on a mission: to make engineering interviews feel more like real work. The traditional tech interview often fails to reflect the actual skills and challenges of software development. Hatchways aims to change that.

### What They Do

Hatchways began by developing customizable, GitHub-based technical assessments. These allow candidates to demonstrate their skills through tasks that mimic real-world work scenarios, such as **reviewing code**, **submitting pull requests**, and **designing systems**. This practical approach not only assesses technical ability but also enhances the overall hiring process by providing more accurate signals about a candidate’s capabilities.

The Hatchways platform emphasizes a streamlined and user-friendly interview process that caters to specific job roles, making the experience more equitable and effective for both candidates and employers.

### Features

- **Real-World Tasks**: Instead of abstract algorithms, candidates face tasks relevant to the job they are applying for. This includes options like bug fixes, feature additions, and code reviews.

- **Easy Assessment Building**: Create assessments using their templates or customize your own. The system supports various programming languages and integrates well with existing workflows.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Hatchways leverages data and industry expertise to help companies design effective assessments that predict on-the-job performance.

- **Integration with ATS**: The platform can seamlessly integrate with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) like Lever, Greenhouse, and Ashby, ensuring recruitment teams can directly manage candidate assessments within their existing systems.

### Team and Growth

Hatchways is a small team of eight but is ambitious and innovative. They currently focus on building a strong community of users and partners, which includes notable names like Plaid and AcuityMD, who praise Hatchways for improving candidate experience and assessment relevance.

### Why Choose Hatchways?

Hatchways stands out in the crowded landscape of tech recruitment platforms by prioritizing the candidate experience. Testimonials highlight the engaging nature of their assessments, with many candidates expressing a preference for real work challenges over outdated theory questions.

Holy Grail is a bold venture with a resolute mission: to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and secure it above ground. Founded in 2019, this Y Combinator Batch S19 startup is rooted in Mountain View, California, where a compact team of 7 fervently works on tackling one of our era's most pressing challenges—climate change.

Their approach is innovative. The technology they employ focuses on tangible and durable carbon removal. Using modular scrubbers powered by electricity, Holy Grail effectively extracts CO2, which is then mineralized and converted into bricks for above-ground storage. This clever system not only efficiently captures carbon but also ensures its permanence through careful monitoring of these mineral formations.

**Core Technology:**
- **CO2 Capture:** The scrubbers are designed for lean manufacturing, allowing for rapid deployment with minimal labor involved. 
- **CO2 Storage:** By turning CO2 into a stable form, like bricks, they prevent it from re-entering the atmosphere—a clear win for long-term sustainability.

Holy Grail operates under various tags such as 'carbon-capture-and-removal,' 'climate-tech,' and 'hardware,' indicating their tech-driven approach to climate solutions.

**Support and Investment:**
The company has garnered solid backing, including notable investors like Kyle Vogt, Patrick Collison, and Ian Hogarth, to name a few. These connections lend not only financial assistance but also invaluable industry insights.

**Join the Movement:**
Holy Grail isn’t just for businesses; they encourage individuals to partake in the carbon capture initiative as well. Whether you’re a company or an individual, there’s a path for everyone to contribute to reducing atmospheric CO2 levels.

It’s part of the Y Combinator Batch S19, which gives it a solid backing from one of the most prestigious startup accelerators. 

Their flagship innovation is a tethered electric aircraft—essentially a kite—equipped with eight onboard turbines. This kite autonomously flies in figure eights, capturing wind energy in a more efficient manner than traditional turbines. The numbers are striking: Kitekraft’s systems require ten times less material and cost half as much as conventional wind turbines. This innovation doesn’t just lower costs; it also opens up new possibilities for locations that were previously deemed unsuitable for wind energy infrastructure, all while minimizing the ecological footprint.

Kitekraft's mission is closely tied to the urgent need for renewable energy in the face of climate change. As fossil fuel consumption leads to rising greenhouse gas levels, the pressure is on to transition to sustainable energy sources. The company rightly identifies that current renewable solutions aren’t expanding fast enough to meet global energy demands, particularly if we aim for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The team at Kitekraft is compact, with only six employees fueling this startup's vision, but they are bolstered by partnerships, such as their group partner, nan. Their work in the realms of hardware, climate, and renewable energy is crucial, as they challenge the status quo of energy production with their innovative approach.

The company’s website, though still in its early stages, serves as a portal for learning more about airborne wind energy, their technology, and how they are executing this ambitious vision[^1^].

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S19,,,"Lofty is a marketplace that let's anyone sell a house to investors online. Instead of the typical real estate transaction where one seller sells to one buyer, Lofty is much more flexible.

Sellers fractionalize their equity ownership in the property into smaller units, so that anyone can buy a portion for as little as $50, allowing access to one of the best asset classes for people who have previously been locked out. Sellers can also sell a portion of their equity (starting at just 10%) instead of the entire property or create customized HELOC structures.

Investors can browse a variety of individual real estate properties ranging from commercial strip malls, a HELOC in someone's house, Airbnbs, to a single-family rental properties, and directly purchase ownership in these properties in under 5 minutes. There is no lockup period. Users can constantly trade these ownerships with others on the marketplace.

Investors truly legally own the properties they invested in and co-manage it with other investors through an online governance program. Owners have so far voted on how to handle various repairs, delinquent tenants, the sale of the underlying property, and much more.

Lofty never custodies or handles user funds or assets. Through smart-contracts on the blockchain, all transactions are directly peer-to-peer.

Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's S19 batch, Lofty is on a mission to democratize real estate investing. Based in Miami, FL, with a nimble team of just seven employees, Lofty operates a marketplace that allows anyone to buy into real estate starting at just $50. It’s a game-changer for investors looking to enter what has traditionally been a high-barrier market.

### How It Works

Lofty’s model breaks away from conventional one-to-one real estate transactions. Sellers can fractionalize their properties, allowing multiple investors to own shares. This flexible structure lets investors co-manage real estate assets via an online governance system. Participants have a real say in property management decisions, from handling repairs to deciding on selling the asset.

Investors access a diverse portfolio of properties, which could include everything from single-family homes to commercial properties and Airbnbs, all at the tip of their fingers. There's no lockup period; ownership can be traded directly between users through smart contracts over blockchain technology—meaning Lofty doesn’t handle or store any funds or assets, which enhances security and trust.

### A Community-Driven Approach

What’s particularly notable about Lofty is its commitment to community. Investors are not just passive participants; they interact and make decisions together about their investments. This dynamic opens a pathway for people who couldn't envision joining the real estate market—think millennials, working professionals, and even those simply seeking additional income streams.

### The Financial Upside

Lofty promises quick returns. Investors begin earning rental income immediately, often within the same day of investment, and benefit from the appreciation of property values over time. This unique model not only fosters wealth-building but also ensures that the everyday person has the tools to build a sustainable financial future without the burdens typically associated with real estate ownership, such as expensive down payments or property management hassles.

### Why Lofty Matters

In a world where rising property prices and stringent lending conditions have kept many from investing in real estate, Lofty stands out as a solution that seeks to change that narrative. Their vision of building the “NASDAQ for real estate” is ambitious, but with their distinctive approach, they might just reshape how we think about investment in this crucial asset class.

Whether you’re an experienced investor or a novice looking to dip your toes in the real estate waters, Lofty offers an innovative pathway to not just observe, but actively participate and grow in this lucrative market.

We started Outtalent because we believe that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not and emerging markets have an exceptional number of great but undervalued engineers. We believe getting a job at one of the worldâs best companies sets people on a great path to realize their full potential.

Outtalent is funded by YCombinator, world-class venture capital funds, executives from Google and Facebook, and other angel investors who are passionate about our mission. We have already helped software engineers from Russia, Ukraine and Central Asia get jobs at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and many other companies in the US, Canada, and Europe.",2019.0,[],"Outtalent is a promising start-up born in 2019, out of the need to bridge the gap for talented engineers from emerging markets. It began with a clear mission: to help exceptional engineers secure positions at leading tech companies, including the likes of Google and Amazon. It's based in San Francisco and part of Y Combinator's Batch S19, which adds a significant stamp of credibility to its venture.

At its core, Outtalent believes in the principle that talent is distributed evenly around the globe, but opportunities often aren’t. By recognizing and harnessing the potential of undervalued engineers in emerging markets, Outtalent is taking steps to align their talent with opportunities in countries like the US, Canada, and Europe. They’ve already made strides in helping software engineers from regions like Russia, Ukraine, and Central Asia transition into robust tech roles.

The company's model is straightforward yet powerful: it offers a structured, online career acceleration program. The program focuses on areas critical to excelling in tech interviews, including algorithms, systems design, and behavioral prep. With support from mentors who are engineers at top tech firms, participants receive tailored training designed to enhance their skills and confidence.

Participants can choose between two tracks: ""Everest"" for more experienced engineers and ""Wonder,"" which is female-only, targeting newer graduates. The program is not just about getting a job; it’s designed to nurture the participants' careers through a tight-knit, supportive community—essentially a fellowship.

Financially, Outtalent's approach makes sense. They charge a modest $1,000 fee at the start and take a 10% cut from the first two years of the pre-tax salary—only if the participant lands a job. This aligns their success with the success of their fellows.

**Website:** [pairteam.com](https://pairteam.com)

**Founded:** 2019, part of Y Combinator Batch S19, based in San Francisco.

**Mission:** Pair Team is dedicated to connecting underserved communities to high-quality healthcare. They focus particularly on high-need Medicaid recipients, addressing both clinical and health-related social needs, like housing and food access. 

### Approach to Care:
Pair Team employs a community-led, virtual care model that meets patients where they are—whether that's in shelters, hospitals, or other community settings. They partner with local organizations, such as shelters and safety-net providers, to deliver a holistic, integrated approach to healthcare. Their care isn't just about treating illnesses; it's about improving overall well-being.

### Key Features:
- **Whole-Person Care:** They provide comprehensive services that include access to medical, mental health, and social services—all at no cost to the patients.
- **Partnership Network:** They collaborate with a diverse range of community-based organizations and healthcare providers to ensure patients receive the support they need.
- **No Cost Model:** Care is funded through initiatives like the Enhanced Care Management (ECM) benefit of Medi-Cal, meaning hospitals and patients don't incur any costs.

### Outcomes:
The impact of their approach is significant:
- They manage over 100,000 lives, reducing emergency room visits by 52%.
- 88% of previously unengaged patients are now reconnected to primary care services.

### Team and Culture:
With a team of 78 dedicated employees led by notable partner Nan, Pair Team cultivates a culture grounded in trust and community collaboration. They recognize that effective healthcare solutions must be tailored to the specific needs of the community, and they constantly seek feedback to refine their strategies.

### Challenges and Innovations:
Pair Team acknowledges the complexity of reaching vulnerable populations, particularly since many of their members have not seen a primary care physician (PCP). To combat this, they actively engage with local organizations to streamline access to care while also providing training and resources for better community engagement.

### In the News:
Pair Team has made headlines for its transition to a Public Benefit Corporation, which aims to bolster its community care hub and enhance its model for high-needs care. They have been recognized in various publications for their effective measures in delivering healthcare to those who need it most, emphasizing the importance of accessibility.

### Conclusion:
Pair Team is reshaping healthcare delivery for underserved populations through innovative, community-driven solutions. By integrating medical care with essential social services, they are not just treating patients; they are transforming lives, one community at a time.

She recruits a class of up to 10 students, and we provide everything she needs to run a microschool - training, support, software, curriculum, and funding so she gets paid. In",2017.0,[],"### Prenda: Redefining K-8 Education with Microschools

**Overview**  
Founded in 2017 and an alum of Y Combinator's Batch S19, Prenda is blazing a new trail in education through its innovative microschool model. Based in Mesa, Arizona, with a growing team of 150, Prenda aims to rekindle the love of learning in children by offering personalized, community-based education.

**Mission**  
At its core, Prenda's mission is to facilitate the establishment of K-8 microschools within local neighborhoods. The premise is straightforward yet powerful: empower passionate adults—often parents or community members—to create small, tailored educational environments for up to 10 students.

**How It Works**  
Prenda provides everything necessary for running a microschool. Here’s what you get:

- **Guidance and Training**: New guides receive comprehensive training and ongoing support, ensuring they’re equipped to nurture learners.
- **Curriculum and Software**: Prenda supplies a flexible curriculum that adapts to students' individual needs alongside intuitive software for school management.
- **Funding**: The model incorporates funding mechanisms so guides can earn a living while contributing to their communities.

**Who Can Be a Guide?**  
You don’t have to be a certified teacher. Many guides come from diverse backgrounds—a blend of educators, parents, and community leaders—all motivated to make a difference. 

**The Prenda Experience**  
A typical day in a Prenda microschool revolves around four key modes of learning:
1. **Connect**: Building values and personal development.
2. **Conquer**: Mastery-focused personalized academics.
3. **Collaborate**: Inquiry-led group activities.
4. **Create**: Hands-on project-based learning.

These principles are designed to keep students actively engaged and help them thrive academically and socially.

**Why Microschools?**  
The advent of microschools addresses a significant challenge: conventional education systems often fail to meet the diverse needs of learners, leading to disengagement. Prenda’s unique approach seeks not just to educate but to inspire curiosity, self-discovery, and a lifelong love for learning.

**Impact and Results**  
Parents rave about the transformation their children experience in Prenda microschools. Students previously struggling in traditional settings often regain their confidence and enthusiasm for learning. With tailored education that meets them at their own level, many children advance beyond their previous academic hurdles.

**Ready to Join?**  
If you're curious about how to create or join a microschool, Prenda offers easy ways to get started, including detailed guides and workshops. Visit [Prenda's Website](https://prenda.com) to learn more about becoming a guide or to find a microschool in your area.

Criminal justice data today is inefficient and ineffective: researchers, advocates, policymakers and practitioners each need funding and time for data collection and cleaning (for almost any data at all), and most data collected is too stale by the time it’s compiled to be useful.

Recidiviz has built an open-source platform to ingest data from across data silos, link it, standardize it, and expose it in usable formats to the ecosystem. We provide products and analyses on top of this platform to help government agencies understand how their justice systems are functioning, set and track progress towards goals, drive evidence-based improvements to practice and policy, and ensure justice-impacted folks reenter their communities as safely and quickly as they can.",2019.0,"[{'name': 'Joshua Essex, Founder', 'description': 'Co-founder and CTO, Recidiviz.

**Mission:** Recidiviz is on a mission to create a smaller, fairer, safer justice system. Founded in 2019 as a non-profit tech organization, it's aimed at driving meaningful changes in criminal justice systems and improving outcomes for those affected by these systems.

**The Problem:** The state of criminal justice data is largely inefficient. Many stakeholders—like researchers, advocates, and policymakers—struggle with obtaining timely and relevant data, often spending an unreasonable amount of time and resources on data cleanup. By the time they’ve gathered information, it's typically outdated and thus less useful.

**The Solution:** Recidiviz has developed an open-source platform that pulls together fragmented criminal justice data, links it, standardizes it, and makes it accessible for analysis. This platform enables government agencies to gain real-time insights into their justice systems, set goals, track progress, and make informed, evidence-based improvements to policies and practices. Their ultimate aim? To help individuals reenter their communities safely and swiftly.

**Team and Operations:** Based in New York, Recidiviz operates with a dedicated team of 80 employees. The organization notably participated in Y Combinator’s S19 batch, gaining invaluable mentorship and resources as it launched its operations.

**Current Focus:** Recidiviz is working on several fronts:
1. Integrating disjointed data from criminal justice agencies.
2. Offering tools for decision-makers at every level.
3. Improving outcomes for individuals impacted by the justice system.

They emphasize a human-centered definition of success, prioritizing the experiences of those affected by the justice system in their approach to restoring equity and facilitating successful reintegration into society.

**Community Engagement:** Through partnerships with state agencies, Recidiviz focuses on fostering collaboration and improving data transparency between sectors. They empower correctional leaders, line staff, and the public by providing access to actionable data visualizations and tools.

**Impact:** Having partnered with states like Idaho, Missouri, Maine, and Tennessee, Recidiviz is recognized for significantly impacting how criminal justice systems operate, underscoring the importance of data in driving systemic change. 

In essence, Recidiviz is harnessing technology to cut through bureaucratic inefficiencies, democratizing access to vital data in the pursuit of a just society. Every person who successfully transitions back into the community, as Recidiviz points out, is a step toward a better society.

Each of these platforms has its own app store or its equivalent, and the enterprising developer must spend thousands of hours building integrations in order to access the entire market.

**Website:** [Rutter](https://rutterapi.com)  
**Mission:** The Universal API for commerce and accounting

### What Does Rutter Do?

Rutter is tackling a significant problem in the fragmented world of business financial data. Just like Plaid unified access to the financial services realm, Rutter is creating a universal API that amalgamates data from various e-commerce platforms, accounting systems, and payment processors. Think of it as a one-stop-shop for integrating and managing financial data from popular platforms like Shopify, Amazon, QuickBooks, NetSuite, Stripe, and more.

### The Problem It Solves

In the existing landscape, developers face an uphill battle; each platform comes with its own integration requirements. They often spend countless hours (and dollars) creating and maintaining these connections, which can be tedious and inefficient. Rutter aims to eliminate that friction by being an integration layer for any company building connections into commerce or accounting platforms.

### Core Offerings

1. **Unified API Model:**  
   Rutter allows developers to ship integrations in days rather than months by offering a standardized data model across platforms.

   - **Accounting API**: Read financial statements, bills, and invoices.

**Founded**: 2018  
**Location**: San Francisco, CA  
**Team Size**: 4 employees  
**Y Combinator Batch**: S19  
**Website**: [soteris.co](http://www.soteris.co)  
**Group Partner**: Nan  

**Mission**: Soteris aims to write machine learning software that more accurately selects and prices insurance risk. They are focused on transforming how auto insurance underwriting is done, specifically targeting the inefficiencies that typically lead to poor risk assessments and inflated loss ratios.

### What Soteris Does

At its core, Soteris is developing a first-of-its-kind, data-driven machine learning pricing system for the insurance industry, starting with personal auto insurance. Their software helps insurers accurately select and quote risks on a policy-by-policy basis in real-time, addressing a critical gap in the conventional underwriting process. 

Traditional methods often force insurers to turn off entire segments of risk due to fears of poor profitability, which results in lost opportunities. Soteris flips that approach by providing policy-level intelligence that enables insurers to keep all segments active. This results in a more inclusive strategy that captures both adequately-rated and inadequately-rated risks, thus expanding potential premium volume.

### The Technology

Soteris leverages a SaaS platform that integrates easily with existing systems, allowing insurers of all sizes to tap into sophisticated data science and machine learning resources. The implementation timeframe is efficient—typically around four months—making it a viable option for firms eager to modernize their underwriting processes.

Key features of Soteris's solution include:
- Predictive scoring of policies in under one second.
- Intelligent selection of risks that minimizes the overall loss ratio.
- Customizable quoting that allows insurers to respond dynamically to market fluctuations and capitalize on favorable risk segments.

### Market Position

Part of the fintech and AI sectors, Soteris is positioned at the intersection of technology and insurance. By addressing a fundamental challenge in risk assessment, they not only aim to improve profitability for insurers but also to modernize outdated underwriting practices that have persisted for decades. The potential to drive down loss ratios while retaining a wider array of risks represents a compelling value proposition.

### Conclusion

Soteris is a promising player in the insurtech space, demonstrating how machine learning can overhaul conventional underwriting. By focusing on smarter risk selection and pricing, Soteris is set to make a notable impact on the insurance landscape, ultimately enabling insurers to grow their businesses while mitigating losses.

Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator Batch S19, spotLESS Materials is a pioneering company located in State College, PA, with a small but agile team of six employees. Their mission? To provide repellent coatings that are free from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a harmful category of chemicals often associated with environmental and health concerns.

The problem they're tackling is significant: surface fouling. Across various industries—think medical, automotive, and beyond—substances like mud, ice, and sludge can severely hamper the performance of crucial components, leading to costly cleaning and replacements. Recognizing this challenge, spotLESS has developed an advanced nanotechnology coating, initially launched as a consumer product, which rapidly found traction in industrial applications.

What sets spotLESS apart is their innovative ""liquid-entrenched smooth surface"" (LESS) technology. They're drawing inspiration from nature—observing the properties of plants and insects—to craft a state-of-the-art, bio-inspired, liquid- and sludge-repellent surface that works wonders on glass, metal, ceramic, and now even plastics. This coating can reduce sludge by up to 90% and mineral deposits by 96% compared to untreated surfaces, while also minimizing the amount of water needed for cleaning.

Their key markets include medical devices (ensuring patient safety and device efficacy), automotive components (enhancing performance under challenging conditions), and sanitation (providing durable, easy-to-clean surfaces). They offer tailored solutions for different industrial needs and emphasize collaboration with clients to understand their specific fouling issues.

SpotLESS Materials operates under several appealing tags in the startup ecosystem: hard-tech, nanotechnology, and advanced materials—hallmarks of innovation driving modern industry challenges.

Founded in 2019, Zippi is a forward-thinking fintech startup based in São Paulo, Brazil, designed to cater to the unique needs of microentrepreneurs in Latin America. As part of Y Combinator’s Batch S19, the company has quickly established itself in the regional financial landscape, currently employing a dedicated team of 60 people.

They enable users to access credit through a hassle-free interface, allowing them to improve their cash flow without the burden of traditional credit card payments. In essence, it’s about providing a lifeline to the small businesses that often have a hard time navigating the bureaucratic waters of credit access.

Here's what makes Zippi particularly compelling:

2. **Flexible Payment System**: With Zippi, payments are processed weekly, giving business owners the ability to manage their finances closely and adapt to their workflow.

3. **Growth-Oriented Features**: The platform’s credit limit is designed to grow alongside the user’s business, rewarding timely repayments with increased limits—a powerful feature that encourages good financial habits.

4. **No More Amateur Setup**: Zippi positions itself as a professional upgrade for microentrepreneurs, helping them transition from reliance on informal credit sources to a more structured financial approach.

The company boasts impressive metrics: over 100,000 transactions per month, reaching more than 3,440 municipalities across Brazil, which underscores its broad impact on the region's microenterprises.

Dalton Caldwell, a Group Partner at Y Combinator, is among the prominent supporters backing Zippi, ensuring it has the mentorship and guidance needed to scale effectively.
