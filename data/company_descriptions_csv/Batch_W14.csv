The Immunity Project isn’t just another biotech company; it’s a beacon of hope in the fight against HIV and AIDS.

They’ve ingeniously hacked the HIV life cycle, creating a vaccine designed to empower individuals with the same immunity as those the industry terms “HIV controllers” — people who naturally manage the virus without medical intervention.

With a compact and dedicated team of 11, Immunity Project is channeling its resources towards turning this vision into a reality. They’ve made significant strides in clinical trials, and the endgame is crystal clear: giving the vaccine away for free to anyone who needs it, breaking down the barriers often associated with access to life-saving medical technology.

Situated in a prime health-tech and biotech hub, Immunity Project taps into the rich ecosystem of innovation that characterizes the San Francisco Bay Area. This location not only supports their mission but connects them with partners and resources that amplify their impact. As they continue their work, they remain committed to their core principle of making healthcare accessible, which stands as a testament to their values.

Founded in 2014 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W14, Noora Health is a pivotal organization based in Bengaluru, India, that’s on a mission to transform healthcare for patients and their families. The organization focuses on training families and caregivers in vital health skills, significantly enhancing care and outcomes within healthcare systems.

### The Vision
Noora Health believes that no one should suffer from preventable medical conditions. Their philosophy hinges on acknowledging that the most significant caregivers—families—often lack the knowledge and training to provide adequate care. This gap leads to preventable complications and, in some cases, even fatalities. By equipping families with essential caregiving skills, Noora Health is striving to change this narrative.

### What They Do
The organization has developed a scalable model of training that integrates seamlessly into existing healthcare frameworks. As a result, families not only become informed caregivers but also active participants in the healing process.

Over the past decade, Noora Health has trained over **20 million caregivers**, representing more than **13 million patients**, and established partnerships with **11,700 healthcare facilities** across India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Their training programs have led to a remarkable **71% decrease in cardiac complications** and a **56% reduction in newborn readmissions**.

### Team and Impact
With a driven team of 150 individuals, Noora Health emphasizes family involvement in healthcare. They’ve received notable recognition, including the **Skoll Foundation Award for Social Innovation** and accolades as an **Audacious Project Grantee**. This speaks volumes about their innovative approach and the tangible impact they are making in communities.

### Get Involved
For those interested in supporting or joining Noora Health’s mission, the organization encourages participation, whether through careers, volunteering, or donations. Every contribution is directed towards enhancing their programs and extending their reach to more families in need.

### Conclusion
As Noora Health celebrates a decade of impact, they reflect on their journey while envisioning a future where families are fully integrated into the healthcare process. They continue to challenge the current healthcare norms, advocating for a system where every family is empowered to provide care for their loved ones effectively. With your support, they aim to expand their programs and drive change in healthcare accessibility and effectiveness, one family at a time.
