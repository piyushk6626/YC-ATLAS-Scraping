Founded in 2021 and proudly a member of Y Combinator’s Batch S21, Adni is on a mission to transform the healthcare recruiting landscape with its innovative AI-powered platform. Based in San Francisco, Adni aims to solve a significant problem in the healthcare sector: the rapid hiring and retention of nurses, which is crucial for maintaining quality patient care.

Adni's platform leverages a robust professional network of nurses alongside advanced talent experience software, enabling employers to hire nurses twice as fast and retain them four times longer than traditional methods. In straightforward terms, this means that Adni not only streamlines the hiring process but also ensures that healthcare facilities can keep their staff longer, all at a cost that is four times cheaper than conventional alternatives. 

It’s a bold claim, but then again, Adni stands on the shoulders of giants, drawing comparisons to Doximity (which went public in 2021), but with a laser focus on the nursing profession. This specialized approach fills a crucial gap in healthcare recruitment, which has often lagged behind other sectors.

With a small, dedicated team of five, led by visionary Group Partner Brad Flora, Adni is carving a niche in the bustling marketplaces of SaaS and B2B healthcare recruiting. They’re part of a growing trend that recognizes the need for modern solutions in an industry that’s often stuck in outdated practices.

Adni’s impact transcends just recruitment; it’s about fostering a sustainable and supportive working environment for nurses, ensuring that they not only find jobs but thrive in them. 

For employers, this means accessing a more efficient, effective way to secure nursing talent in an increasingly competitive market—a necessity as the demand for healthcare professionals continues to surge.

In summary, Adni is not just about hiring nurses; it's about reshaping how healthcare providers approach staffing, making it faster, cheaper, and more sustainable. You can explore more about Adni and their offerings on their website: [Adni](https://www.adni.co/).

Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, Akute Health is disrupting the healthcare landscape from its base in Austin, Texas. The company’s mission? To create the best electronic medical record (EMR) system tailored for digital health companies.

The inspiration behind Akute Health is personal. In 2015, during a harrowing cancer battle that saw the founder in the hospital for nine months, the need for a robust yet simple way to track medical records became painfully clear. Out of this necessity, Akute Health was born, evolving from a simple tracking app into a comprehensive EMR system used by clinical teams at companies akin to Ro and Hims.

Today, Akute Health serves hundreds of clients and manages over 50,000 active patient records. And it’s not just another EMR; it’s designed to reduce screen time and enable more patient interaction, seamlessly integrating features like telemedicine, e-prescribing, and self-scheduling right into its mobile-friendly platform.

With a lean team of four and a vision for efficiency, Akute Health is saving healthcare professionals an hour a day through automation and task management tools. They cater to a variety of sectors within the healthcare ecosystem, including Direct Primary Care (DPC) and aesthetic practices.

Their commitment to data security is also noteworthy: all operations are HIPAA compliant, ensuring patient information is encrypted both at rest and in transit. 

If you’re looking for a modern and intuitive EMR that enhances patient care rather than complicating it, Akute Health could very well be the answer. Interested in learning more? They offer demos, and you can explore further on their website: [Akute Health](https://www.akutehealth.com).

Founded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, AlgoUniversity is on a mission to build a job-driven virtual tech university dedicated to the aspirations of Indian students. With a base in Hyderabad, this innovative edtech startup aims to address the skills gap in the tech industry through a unique model of education and mentorship.

### **The Model**

At its core, AlgoUniversity combines rigorous live instruction from top-tier educators—many of whom hail from giants like Google and Facebook—with a real-world approach to learning. Students engage in year-long cohorts, and they only begin to pay for their education once they secure a job in the tech field, a model known as the Income Sharing Agreement (ISA). 

### **What They Offer**

- **Hands-On Learning:** The curriculum focuses heavily on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which are crucial for tech interviews, making up about 60-70% of the interview process. Students also undertake industry-oriented projects under the guidance of experienced mentors.
  
- **Placement Success:** The results speak volumes—over 1,380 students have been trained and placed, with the highest CTC reaching ₹41 LPA and an average hike of about 110% on their previous salaries.

- **Special Programs:** Their weekend-oriented ""Leap Batch"" is catered to working professionals, designed by alumni of IIIT-Hyderabad and IIT-Bombay. This program emphasizes quick doubt resolution, externship certificates, and job placements that can begin just three months after starting.

### **The Team**

AlgoUniversity boasts a small, agile team of just 10 employees—many of whom are ACM ICPC finalists and engineers from leading tech companies. The founders and mentors are not only educators but also seasoned professionals who understand the demands of the tech industry inside out.

### **Proven Impact**

Students like Mayank Verma and Pallavi Sahu have shared their transformative experiences, highlighting how the curriculum and mentorship at AlgoUniversity enabled them to transition from non-tech jobs to lucrative software engineering positions. The testimonials are filled with stories of impressive salary hikes, international offers, and successful career switches.

### **Financing Your Education**

Their fee structure is straightforward: an initial ₹5,000 enrollment fee (refundable within 21 days) and subsequent payments of ₹5,000 per month for six months. Once employed, students pay an additional ₹40,000 in easy installments—making it a low-risk investment for those eager to enter the tech workforce.

Founded in 2020 and thriving in the San Francisco area, this innovative health tech startup is revolutionizing how we approach early treatment of pre-cancerous cervical lesions with its portable cryoablation unit, making it accessible to clinics worldwide.

Here's the kicker: while cervical cancer is more than 90% preventable, a staggering 40 million people with a cervix miss out on crucial prevention technologies each year. They set out to change that by creating a system that costs just 1/10 of what traditional cryoablation systems do, which often rely on bulky gas canisters and specialized staff. Ananya's device allows nurses and other lower-level health care workers to provide treatment right where it's needed—at the point of care—significantly reducing barriers to access.

As a Y Combinator Batch S21 company, Ananya Health has been making waves, evidenced by their recent achievement of securing a $2.3 million grant from the National Cancer Institute. This funding will help expedite the development and optimization of their flagship product, the CRCL™ system, designed to freeze abnormal cells effectively and painlessly.

The company’s team of six is led by co-founder and CEO Anu Parvatiyar, who, along with co-founder Julie Yip and CTO Allen Chang, brings diverse backgrounds in engineering, innovation, and health care to the table. They understand that the future of women’s health relies on overcoming existing treatment access barriers through innovative technology.

In the bigger picture, Ananya Health is aligned with global health efforts, seeking to contribute to the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating cervical cancer in our lifetime. Their vision is clear: to prevent cervical cancer in every clinic, everywhere, ensuring that no woman misses out on life-saving treatment.

In summary, if you want to know a company that’s harnessing cutting-edge technology to save lives, look no further than Ananya Health.

Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch S21, Ancana is transforming the way we think about vacation ownership. Based in Mérida, Mexico, this innovative company offers a marketplace for fractional ownership of managed vacation homes. With a small but dedicated team of seven, Ancana is spearheaded by Aaron Epstein as their Group Partner.

**Mission and Business Model**

The mission of Ancana is straightforward yet impactful: to make vacation home ownership accessible and hassle-free. Unlike traditional models like timeshares, where you buy the right to use a property, Ancana allows individuals to purchase 1/4 or 1/8 shares of a luxury vacation home. This means if you own a 1/4 share, you can enjoy the home for three months of the year.

Here's how it works:

1. **Investment Trust Creation**: For each property, Ancana sets up an investment trust, dividing the home into shares that can be purchased by qualified co-owners.
2. **Co-Owner Management**: They facilitate the entire purchasing process, connect like-minded co-owners, and handle the furnishing and ongoing management of the property.
3. **Ownership and Flexibility**: Once all shares are sold, Ancana transitions to a property management role, leaving co-owners with actual asset ownership. Owners can sell their shares whenever they want, reaping any appreciation the property may have gained.

**Key Benefits**

- **Real Asset Ownership**: Owners are investing in a tangible asset rather than just a block of time.
- **Effective Management**: Ancana manages all upkeep and cleaning, allowing owners to focus on relaxation and creating memories.
- **Flexible Usage**: Owners can use their home on their terms and even rent out unused weeks to earn income.

**Current Offerings**

Ancana provides access to luxury homes across various stunning destinations in Mexico, catering to different tastes—be it historical cities, tropical beaches, or serene mountains. They also offer a rental program and opportunities for global property exchanges through partnerships, further enhancing the experience for their co-owners.

**Looking Ahead**

As Ancana continues to grow, they are focused on expanding their offerings and helping more people embrace the joys of ownership without the complexities typically associated with second homes. With a clear vision and an innovative model, Ancana is poised to redefine vacation home ownership for the modern traveler.

Founded in 2020 and hailing from the bustling financial hub of New York, Aqua is an innovative fintech startup that aims to streamline how financial advisors access alternative assets for their clients. It initially emerged from Y Combinator’s S21 batch, and its mission is straightforward: to empower financial advisors to seamlessly invest in alternative asset classes—something typically reserved for large institutions and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.

### What Aqua Does

Aqua is an end-to-end platform tailored for financial advisors, designed to facilitate investments in curated alternative assets without the cumbersome operational overhead. This platform connects advisors to a handpicked selection of top-tier private equity, venture capital, and real estate funds, effectively democratizing access to wealth-building opportunities that have historically been out of reach.

**Investment Opportunities**: Alternative investments can include private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, and real estate, all of which Aqua provides personalized access to. Their approach not only increases exposure to higher-performing investments but also allows for better portfolio diversification.

### The Team

With a compact team of six employees, Aqua is spearheaded by co-founders Rohan Marwaha and Dev Patel, both of whom bring rich backgrounds in the finance and technology sectors. Rohan's past experience at Blackstone enlightened him to the demand for alternative asset access, while Dev complements this vision with robust technological expertise garnered from Bank of America.

### Product Offerings

**1. Access Funds**: Aqua handles all operational details, simplifying the investment process for financial advisors.
   
**2. Aqua Connect**: This feature enables wealth managers to access a curated selection of top-performing funds, further enhancing their ability to provide bespoke investment options for clients.
   
**3. Feeder Funds**: Designed for fund managers, this service aggregates smaller investments, ideal for unlocking a wider investor base without adding administrative burdens.

### Market Position and Validation

Aqua has already managed to secure a total investment amounting to $2.45 million, showcasing strong engagement and confidence from its customers. The company is backed by notable investors, emphasizing its credibility and potential in the alternative investment space.

### The Bigger Picture

In today's investing landscape, diversification is not just smart; it's essential. While professional investors typically allocate about 50% of their assets into alternatives, everyday investors often find themselves limited to a mere 5%. Aqua aims to bridge this gap, ensuring that a wider audience can partake in the substantial returns that alternative investments can provide.

### Closing Thoughts

Aqua stands at the intersection of technology and finance, poised to change the way advisors and their clients approach investments. With a strong backing, a deliberate service model, and an accessible platform, they are set to redefine what it means to invest in alternatives. For financial advisors keen on modernizing their investment strategies, Aqua might just be the partner they’ve been looking for.

On a mission to help dev teams ship fast & reliable systems that keep users happy and pagers silent.', 'linkedin': 'https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hveldstra'}]","### Artillery: Revolutionizing Load Testing for the Modern Era

**Overview**  
Founded in 2021 and based in Limerick, Ireland, Artillery is a rising star in the realm of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). This company emerged from Y Combinator's S21 batch, and it’s carving out a unique niche in the tech landscape.

**Mission**  
Artillery's mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to create a modern testing platform optimized for DevOps and SRE practices, aiming to make load testing accessible, scalable, and efficient.

**What They Do**  
Initially, Artillery began as a comprehensive load testing platform designed for continuous testing. Its standout feature allows users to run load tests from their own AWS account without the burden of infrastructure management. This approach has garnered the attention of thousands of developer teams, helping them maintain fast and reliable production systems.

**Key Features**  
- **Scalable and Serverless:** Artillery leverages serverless load generators to execute tests within your AWS or Azure environment, ensuring cost-effectiveness as users only pay for what they use.
- **Comprehensive Testing Capabilities:** It can test web applications, APIs, GraphQL services, WebSockets, and more—encompassing a wide range of use cases.
- **Easy Integration:** With over 20 integrations available, including for popular CI/CD tools and monitoring services, Artillery fits smoothly into existing workflows.
- **Continuous Testing Focus:** The platform is built for continuous testing, allowing developer teams to keep their systems resilient through regular load checks.

**Current Landscape**  
Artillery is quite small, with a tight-knit team of five, and showcases a flexible work environment. Aaron Epstein serves as their Group Partner, providing guidance and strategic direction.

**Why Artillery Matters**  
In a world where traffic spikes and new code deployments can jeopardize service reliability, traditional load testing methods often fall short. Artillery is addressing these gaps by offering a tool that is not only easy to use but also robust enough to facilitate real-time testing. It’s a fresh take on load testing informed by hands-on experience in production engineering.

**The Future Vision**  
Artillery aims to redefine the load testing landscape so that teams can go from zero to production-scale testing rapidly.

As a doctoral student, he won the national Three Minute Thesis (3mt) competition, Baylor Business Plan, elevator pitch competition, and VentureWell’s BMEidea competition. Mustafa has raised over $5M for Astek to date to revolutionize antibiotic prescription.', 'linkedin': None}]","Astek Diagnostics is an innovative health tech company established in 2020, based in Baltimore, Maryland. It's a fresh participant in the Y Combinator Batch S21 — so you know they’re not your average startup. With a tight-knit team of five, they're laser-focused on revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat bacterial infections, especially urinary tract infections (UTIs) which often lead to severe complications, including sepsis.

Their flagship product, the JIDDU system, provides a one-hour antibiotic sensitivity test, a massive improvement over traditional testing methods that can take days. The technology behind this system tracks oxygen consumption of bacteria, allowing healthcare providers to pinpoint effective treatment options almost instantly. This is not just a convenience but a potentially life-saving breakthrough—25% of sepsis cases stem from UTIs, and women are affected far more frequently than men.

Astek's mission revolves around ""better diagnostics, better treatment."" The goal is clear: save lives by removing the guesswork from antibiotic prescribing. They’ve partnered with esteemed healthcare institutions, including The University of Maryland Medical Center and MedStar Health, to ensure that they’re grounding their technology in real-world clinical needs. The potential for their platform extends beyond UTIs; Astek envisions a universal diagnostic system that could analyze other sample types like blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

What’s even more interesting is the personal story behind the company’s inception. CEO Mustafa Al Adhami was inspired to start Astek after witnessing his grandfather suffer through a prolonged misdiagnosis of a UTI. This wasn’t just a business venture for him; it was about addressing a clear and urgent need in healthcare.

With a strong footing in critical medical tech domains like microfluidics and medical devices, Astek Diagnostics is not just participating in the healthcare conversation. They are leading it, pushing for precision diagnostics that can reduce unnecessary treatments, lower healthcare costs, and ultimately mitigate the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. Expect to hear more from them as they gear up for a market entry in 2025.

We build tools that help teams modernise, write and understand legacy codebases, with the help of generative AI.",2021.0,[],"**Bloop: Modernizing Legacy Code with AI**

Founded in 2021 and hailing from the bustling tech scene of London, Bloop is on a mission to revolutionize how companies handle legacy code, particularly from the old guard of programming languages like COBOL. With many Fortune 500 companies still reliant on mainframes, Bloop recognizes that the need for innovation, alongside cost and skills pressures, makes modernization not just a preference but a necessity.

Bloop's approach leverages the power of generative AI to create tools that help teams not only modernize legacy codebases but also understand and write them. The focus is on converting COBOL into readable Java—code that's not just functional but human-friendly. Forget about the infamous results of traditional conversion methods; Bloop prides itself on producing clear, maintainable code, ready for teams to innovate upon. 

With its roots in Y Combinator's Batch S21, Bloop operates with a lean team of ten talented employees, including notable backing from Jared Friedman as the Group Partner. They are deeply engaged in AI, machine learning, and open-source technologies, with a strong emphasis on making modernization safe and straightforward.

### What Do They Offer?

1. **Functionally Equivalent Conversion**: Bloop ensures that converted Java programs exhibit identical behavior to their COBOL predecessors, validated through extensive AI-powered testing.
   
2. **Readable Code**: The goal is clarity. Bloop’s code conversions aim for readability that aligns with human writing, steering clear of confusing mix-ups like ""Jobol"" or ""Cava.""

3. **Open Source Solutions**: They favor using open-source libraries and cloud services, which lowers costs and enhances flexibility.

4. **Easy Modifications**: Post-conversion, the new code is designed to be modified without necessitating extensive refactoring, allowing for agile responses to deadline-driven demands.

5. **Safety in Conversion**: Their automatic translations come with built-in correctness checks to safeguard against errors, which often plague manual rewrites.

### The Process

Bloop's modernizations unfold in a few clear steps:
- **Initial Survey**: They assess the existing environment and identify potential risks.
- **Proof-of-Concept**: A short sprint converts a segment of the codebase to showcase the value of their solution.
- **Full Modernization**: Finally, they onboard the client's team for a complete transformation, setting them up to leapfrog into innovation.

### Why Partner with Bloop?

In an age where the speed of innovation can determine a company’s survival, Bloop’s vision is about liberating teams from the constraints of legacy systems. By automating tedious engineering tasks, they help businesses sharpen their focus on what truly matters: creating value and driving forward with new ideas.

Imagine needing to cover a bill before your next paycheck hits—Bree allows users to access cash advances up to $500 without any interest or hidden fees.

Buoyant Aero is on a mission to revolutionize the middle-mile air freight industry using drone blimps. This innovative approach aims to deliver goods at half the cost of traditional small aircraft. Founded in 2020 by two MIT hardware engineers with a solid background in satellite technology, Buoyant Aero is gearing up to tackle air cargo challenges, particularly in remote areas like Alaska and northern Canada.

The company has made impressive strides since its inception. They've developed and successfully flown four blimps, the latest being a 20-foot long model capable of reaching speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. With a growing interest reflected in $5 million in Letters of Intent (LOIs) and upcoming pilot programs, Buoyant Aero is poised to disrupt the logistics landscape.

While initially focused on enhancing air cargo efficiencies in sparsely populated regions, their vision includes scaling operations to handle less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments worldwide. The company is headquartered in San Francisco and is part of the renowned Y Combinator Batch S21, which underscores its potential for growth and innovation in the autonomous delivery sector.

With a lean team of just two employees and backing from notable partners, including Nan—their group partner—Buoyant Aero is an exciting name to watch. Their technology not only paves the way for cost-effective shipping but also hints at broader applications, including wildlife protection through aerial monitoring.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S21,,,We believe that no emergency should have to wait. To make this a reality we build AI that instantly reads medical scans and enables critical care teams to make diagnoses better than radiologists. This saves lives by getting emergencies to treatment immediately and by discharging non-emergent patients quickly so the next emergency doesn’t have to wait either.,2021.0,[],"**Caire Health: Innovating Emergency Care with AI**

Founded in 2021 and a proud member of Y Combinator’s Batch S21, Caire Health operates out of Florida with a compact yet focused team of three. Their mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to eliminate delays in emergency care through semi-autonomous diagnostics. They leverage artificial intelligence to instantly analyze medical scans, enabling critical care teams to diagnose conditions with greater accuracy than traditional radiologists.

### The Problem with Current Emergency Imaging

Emergency rooms often face a bottleneck due to slow imaging report turnaround times. These delays can lead to poor patient outcomes, especially for those with emergent conditions. Caire Health recognizes that many patients without urgent findings are discharged much too slowly, clogging up the system and increasing frustrations for both healthcare providers and patients. At the same time, ER physicians are overwhelmed with scans, raising their risk of burnout and malpractice claims.

### The Caire Health Solution: Caire Head CT

Caire’s flagship product, the Caire Head CT, transforms the landscape of emergency diagnostics. Here are some key features and benefits of their AI-driven solution:

- **Rapid Diagnosis:** The AI can instantly detect or rule out intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) and other emergent pathologies.
- **High Accuracy:** Validation studies show a sensitivity and specificity exceeding 97%, which significantly enhances both ER physician and radiologist diagnostic accuracy—by over 5%.
- **Efficiency Boosts:** Provides readouts on emergent findings almost immediately while patients are still undergoing scanning, ensuring that unnecessary delays are minimized.
- **Automation of Routine Tasks:** By automating tedious tasks like quantifying ventricle volume, it reduces physician workload and allows them more time for patient care.

### Seamless Integration

Caire Health’s system is designed to integrate natively with numerous EMR and PACS providers without the need for additional apps or downloads, making it a seamless addition to any hospital's existing infrastructure. This interoperability alleviates pressure on IT departments, as Caire manages 95% of the integration process.

### The Future of Emergency Care

In a world where every second counts, Caire Health is poised to revolutionize emergency medicine. Their AI technology not only improves the precision of diagnoses but also facilitates quicker patient discharges, ultimately enhancing overall hospital efficiency. With a mission that prioritizes timely treatment, Caire Health ensures that no emergency has to wait.

At the heart of Deskimo is an app that transforms the way you find and book workspaces. Here’s how it works:
1. **Instant Access:** Users open the app, tap to generate a QR code, and simply scan it at the workspace entrance. There’s no need for membership fees, registrations, or waiting lists—just find a spot, check in, and get to work.

Deskimo is critical in this shift toward decentralization.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S21,,,"In the global fight against breast cancer, Digistain stands at the forefront, offering a beacon of hope to millions. Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics.

The Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapy—a treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself.

Our Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects.

Impact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care.

Recognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a company—it’s a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment.

Emerging from groundbreaking research at Imperial College London, Digistain addresses a significant gap in the fight against breast cancer—specifically, the lack of accessible, timely, and cost-effective genomic testing post-surgery.

### The Challenge
Every year, 2.3 million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer. Following surgery, 60% of these patients are recommended for expensive genomic testing—often taking up to two months and costing around $4,000. Unfortunately, only 5% can access these crucial tests, leading many to default into often unnecessary chemotherapy treatments.

### Our Solution
Digistain's innovative technology enables hospitals to conduct in-house analyses of breast cancer biopsies using existing equipment. This game-changing approach provides near-instantaneous decision-making data, drastically reducing the wait time from weeks to potentially less than an hour. At its core, Digistain uses a proprietary algorithm to identify a spectral fingerprint of tumors in the infrared spectrum, resulting in a unique Digistain Prognostic Score that informs oncologists in tailoring personalized treatment plans.

### Impact and Potential
Digistain's work challenges not just the technological aspects of cancer diagnostics, but accessibility as well. It has already shown clinical evidence comparable to the industry leader—yet at a fraction of the typical costs and time requirements. With backing from reputable organizations, including the NHS, Y Combinator, and the Royal Society, and with a diverse team of 40, this technology is quickly making a mark in clinical practices globally.

### Recognition and Future
Digistain is not just a company; it’s a movement toward equitable cancer care. Recognized for its contributions and supported by significant partnerships, it strives to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics. By changing how we assess and treat breast cancer, Digistain is actively creating a healthier tomorrow.

Founded in 2020 and hailing from the Y Combinator Batch S21, Epinoma is a San Francisco-based biotech company with a clear mission: *We engineer proteins that control the operating system of biology.* With a small team of just 8 innovative minds, Epinoma is tackling the intricate world of epigenetics, where subtle changes in gene expression can have profound implications for health and disease.

#### What They Do

Epinoma is at the forefront of synthetic biology, leveraging advanced protein engineering to develop epigenetic-driven diagnostics and therapeutics. Their focus is on understanding and manipulating epigenetic marks—those chemical modifications of DNA and proteins that regulate gene expression without altering the underlying genetic code.

In their pursuit to unlock this next frontier of biology, Epinoma is exploring three main avenues:

1. **Disease Detection**: Current methods for detecting diseases, especially early signs of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, are often noisy and imprecise. Epinoma aims to refine these techniques, using methylation—an influential epigenetic cue—to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

2. **Precision Epigenetic Medicine**: By acting as programmable switches for gene expression, Epinoma is developing therapies that can modulate epigenetic sites, providing an innovative approach to treatment that retains the genomic sequence intact.

3. **Biopharma Acceleration**: Epinoma’s insights into the differences between healthy and diseased epigenetic states are crucial for drug development. Their work allows for better screening of preclinical compounds and improves patient stratification in clinical settings based on methylation patterns.

#### Why It Matters

The power of epigenetics lies in its potential to change our understanding of diseases and lead to breakthroughs in treatment. Epinoma’s work not only promises advancements in diagnostics but also points to a future where therapies could be tailored with remarkable precision, revolutionizing how we approach health and medicine.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from the heart of Silicon Valley, San Jose, California, Ferveret is making waves in the tech landscape with its innovative liquid cooling solutions influenced by nuclear power plant technology. This startup emerged from the Y Combinator Batch S21, and its mission is crystal clear: to revolutionize how data centers cool their systems, reducing both environmental impact and operational costs.

#### The Problem with Current Cooling Systems

Did you know that around 40% of the electricity consumed by data centers is wasted on cooling? That’s a staggering statistic! As data generation skyrockets—projected to reach dizzying heights—so too does the electricity consumption of these facilities, which could account for 9% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030. Add to that the fact that inefficient cooling contributes roughly 40% of emissions from data centers, and it’s clear that a solution is needed.

#### Innovative Technology and Impressive Savings

Ferveret tackles this problem head-on with its cutting-edge technology that not only eliminates waste but also enhances chip performance. Their solutions claim to save data centers an impressive **96% in cooling costs**, **68% on capital expenditures**, and **reduce carbon footprints by 40%**, all while doubling the performance of CPUs and GPUs. They achieve this through a process known as subcooled boiling, which allows for remarkably efficient heat removal from processors and other high-heat components.

#### A Focus on Diverse Industries

Ferveret's applications are broad, touching sectors like:

- **Data Centers:** Combat inefficient cooling strategies that are both costly and environmentally damaging.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Support the computational demands of AI applications, ensuring systems run cooler and more efficiently.
- **Crypto Mining:** Enhance performance through overclocking techniques, reducing noise and energy expenditures in crypto facilities.
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Address the substantial cooling needs of sensor and battery technology.

#### Meet the Team

Behind this ambitious project is a diverse team of six leading experts. Co-founders Dr. Reza Azizian and Dr. Matteo Bucci bring rich backgrounds from MIT and the cooling industry, while Andrea Marini, the Chief Revenue Officer, has extensive experience with companies like Dell Technologies and Genesys. This combination of technical prowess and business acumen positions Ferveret as a formidable player in the industry.

#### Investors and Future Vision

Ferveret is backed by notable investors, including Y Combinator, MIT E14 Fund, and Climate Capital, indicating strong confidence in its potential. As the startup prepares to scale its operations, it’s focused not just on profitability, but on making a significant positive impact in the climate space.

#### Conclusion

Ferveret is not just another tech startup; it’s a bold step toward a more efficient and sustainable future for data centers, leveraging the lessons learned from nuclear cooling systems. As the demand for advanced computing grows, so does the opportunity for Ferveret to lead the charge in cooling innovation.

Founded in Nairobi, Kenya, and part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, Fingo addresses a critical pain point: high money transfer fees that currently range from 5% to 15%. By introducing its platform, Fingo promises to make these transfers up to 90% cheaper.

With an easy onboarding process that allows users to access a full suite of financial services—including personal, business, investment, and savings accounts—in just about 240 seconds, Fingo is designed for efficiency and user-friendliness. The company's small but dedicated team of eight employees is focused on creating a dynamic banking experience that empowers users to manage their finances better.

Fingo's platform not only facilitates peer-to-peer transfers among users without transaction fees but also offers tools for budgeting, savings, and financial literacy through engaging trivia games. Users earn Fingo Coins with each transaction, encouraging responsible spending and providing opportunities for rewards.

The bank has features tailored for various financial needs. There are plans for both personal and corporate accounts, each equipped with specific tools for managing finances effectively. Notably, the Interest-Earning Savings account promises competitive annual rates of up to 15%, underscoring Fingo's commitment to enhancing savings for its community.

In collaboration with Ecobank, Fingo is regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), elevating user trust and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. With ambitions to grow beyond 100,000 clients towards the goal of serving 100 million, Fingo is not just about banking; it is about building a community where young Africans can thrive financially.

### How It Works
Flowly's platform combines cutting-edge VR technology with biofeedback tools, including a heart rate sensor that provides real-time data about the user's physiological state. Subscribers not only get access to the app but also a $5 VR headset to enhance their experience. This technology allows Flowly to tailor immersive experiences that have been shown to reduce pain by 46%.

With an impressive statistic that 88% of participants report benefits from the program, and 55% noting improved sleep, the method is scientifically backed and recommended by healthcare providers.

### Insurance and Accessibility

Fluke is a trailblazing digital mobile operator based in Brazil, founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S21. It emerged as a revolutionary response to the frustrations associated with traditional telecommunications providers. Numerous Brazilians found themselves shackled by unwanted data packages and inflexible plans, prompting Fluke to focus on crafting a superior customer experience.

Their mission is straightforward: to enhance the mobile experience while keeping costs low. By renting infrastructure from established players like Vivo, Fluke can redirect its resources towards customer-centric services. This strategy has resulted in a customer acquisition cost (CAC) that is 50% lower and a customer lifetime value (LTV) that is 30% higher than that of traditional carriers.

### What Makes Fluke Stand Out?

1. **Flexibility**: Customers can tailor their mobile plans precisely to their needs. Whether it’s choosing their data allowances or adding features, the options are abundant—without the burden of contracts.

2. **Simplicity**: Fluke’s app provides a seamless way for customers to handle everything from plan adjustments to tracking usage. No more frustrating calls to customer service; a friendly chat feature ensures human help is just a message away.

3. **No More Telemarketing**: In an era where unsolicited sales calls become a chronic annoyance, Fluke’s commitment to a telemarketing-free experience is refreshing.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Utilizing Vivo's well-established network through a partnership with Telecall, Fluke guarantees extensive coverage throughout Brazil. 

5. **Portability Made Easy**: Switching to Fluke is hassle-free. The app handles the porting process, meaning customers can ditch their old plans without the typical rigmarole.

### Product Offerings

Fluke offers a variety of plan options:
- **Ready-made Packages**: These include fixed amounts of data and unlimited calling, including options for popular apps like WhatsApp without data charges.
  - **6GB** for R$37/month
  - **12GB** for R$53/month
  - **20GB** for R$90/month
  - **50GB** for R$199/month

- **Customized Plans**: Tailor your own package based on how much data, minutes, and SMS you really need, paying only for what you want. This plan also charges a nominal monthly fee to keep unused data from expiring.

### The Team and Vision

Based in São Carlos, Brazil, Fluke operates with a dedicated team of 18 employees. Aiming to replicate the transformational effect that Nubank had on the banking sector, Fluke is set to challenge the norms of mobile telecommunications in Brazil.

Their clear vision and effective execution have attracted attention, ensuring they will continue to be a formidable force in the Brazilian market.

By making it simpler for businesses to serve low-income families, they are effectively enhancing the shopping experience and supporting the economy. The company's reliability is impressive, boasting a 99.9% uptime and USDA approval as one of only three providers to process EBT payments.

The potential impact of Forage is substantial—a streamlined digital payment process for government benefits translates directly into improved accessibility, higher sales, and an enriched shopping environment for millions.

### Who They Work With

Forage has collaborated with notable brands such as DoorDash and Thrive Market, allowing these companies to expand their services to a demographic that typically faces barriers in online grocery shopping.

GamerPay is laser-focused on creating a trustworthy environment for trading gaming assets. In just three months since launch, they've processed an impressive $245,000 in transactions, growing 30% month-over-month. Conversations with 5,000 gamers revealed a staggering statistic: 46% of those surveyed have been scammed multiple times, with over half being minors. Many of these young traders resort to cash transactions on social media due to age restrictions. 

Recognizing this critical gap, GamerPay has introduced a fully compliant system for obtaining parental consent, making it easier and safer for younger gamers to trade legally while giving parents peace of mind.

**Market Potential**  
With a massive annually supported trading volume of 215 million transactions across the games they cover, GamerPay stands to harness significant market potential. At an average fee of $7 per trade, the marketplace is eyeing a market worth around $1.5 billion. As gaming and blockchain economies continue to expand, GamerPay is well-positioned for rapid growth.

**The Team**  
The company is powered by a talented team of six, including co-founders with prior experience in building one of Denmark's largest transactional marketplaces for high-end second-hand clothes, boasting a user base of one million and generating over $40 million in annual GMV. Their expertise and insight into marketplaces are pivotal in navigating the complex landscape of gaming assets.

**Backing and Future Outlook**  
GamerPay is part of Y Combinator's Batch S21, mentored by renowned Group Partner Michael Seibel. This affiliation not only lends credibility but also access to resources and networking opportunities essential for scaling effectively.

With the gaming landscape continually evolving, GamerPay is positioned to disrupt the market, making trading gaming skins and assets safer, easier, and more enjoyable for everyone involved.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S21,,,"We are disrupting hospitality hiring by reducing the time it takes to hire staff from months to < 3 days.

Hiring staff is the biggest challenge for many of the 2M+ hospitality businesses in Europe. Covid and Brexit ceased the usual oversupply of candidates, making traditional job boards unable to meet employers' needs, and agencies more expensive than ever. As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.

At Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.

To date, weâve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",2021.0,"[{'name': 'Alex Zhou, Founder', 'description': 'Alex (CEO) went to the #1 school in the world for hospitality, is a 2x YC founder, and spent the last 3 years selling B2B2C tech.', 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderzhou/'}, {'name': 'Lorenzo Sani, Founder', 'description': ""Co-Founder and CTO at Shopscribe.

**Mission Statement**: Hirebolt aims to help businesses hire staff quickly, eliminating hours of tedious administrative work. The company, founded in 2021, seeks to revolutionize how hospitality businesses recruit, shortening the hiring process from several months to under three days.

#### The Problem

For over 2 million hospitality businesses in Europe, hiring is a massive challenge, compounded by the effects of COVID and Brexit. With fewer candidates available, traditional job boards are failing to deliver qualified applicants, leading to manual candidate sourcing and unnecessary filtering through irrelevant CVs. To make matters worse, about 80% of candidates invited to an interview don’t even show up.

#### The Solution: Hirebolt

Hirebolt streamlines the hiring process by leveraging AI technology to find and vet actively-looking candidates. Here's how it works:

1. Businesses specify their hiring needs.
2. Relevant candidates are delivered directly, often through WhatsApp, the same day.
3. Employers can review candidate profiles and Hirebolt handles the rest—scheduling interviews and reminding candidates to show up.

This efficient system frees up employers' time, allowing them to focus on their core operations instead of getting bogged down in the hiring process.

#### Backed by Strong Investors

To date, Hirebolt has raised around $1.5 million from reputable investors, including Y Combinator and other prominent venture capital firms. Being part of the Y Combinator Batch S21 underscores their potential in the tech and HR landscape.

#### A Focused Team

Located in London, Hirebolt operates with a lean team of just three employees, including co-founders Alex and Lorenzo, who have experience developing technology solutions for local businesses.

#### Why Hirebolt?

Employers benefit from:
- **Vetted candidates delivered daily** – Minimizing the time wasted on irrelevant job board applications.
- **Cost-Effectiveness** – Hirebolt claims to be approximately 26 times cheaper than traditional recruitment agencies while giving employers full control over the hiring process.
- **Employer Support** – They chase candidates for interviews and provide insights into no-shows, addressing a critical pain point for businesses.

#### Conclusion

Hirebolt is addressing a significant void in the hospitality hiring market—one that’s only grown more pressing as traditional methods falter. By fusing tech with recruitment, they’re not just streamlining processes but fundamentally changing the way businesses think about hiring. If you’re in hospitality and tired of the sourcing grind, Hirebolt might just be the solution you've been waiting for.

Founded in 2020 and based in Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel, Hypercore emerged from a shared vision among its founders, who previously served together in technological units of the Israeli Defense Forces. Their experience in developing fintech solutions revealed a significant gap in tools available to lenders, particularly in the private sector. This led them to create Hypercore, a loan management software focused on automating workflows for private lenders who are largely reliant on archaic systems like Excel.

**Mission and Offerings**

Hypercore's mission is simple yet profound: to upgrade loan management for private lenders. The platform automates various aspects of lending—from managing loan lifecycles to monitoring funding sources and generating insightful analytics and reports. Their goal is to create a ""Nasdaq of private loan books,"" enabling lenders to efficiently securitize their loan portfolios through a robust data-driven approach.

With a current Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) of $3.5K from paid pilots and an additional $1.5K in Letters of Intent (LOI), it's clear that Hypercore is making strides in the competitive fintech landscape. They are part of Y Combinator’s S21 batch, which solidifies their credibility and potential for growth.

**Key Features and Innovations**

Hypercore offers several core features aimed at enhancing lending operations:
- **Loan Management**: A comprehensive tool that allows lenders to manage every step of the loan lifecycle efficiently.
- **Funding Sources Management**: Enables lenders to track gains and allocations across different sources of capital.
- **Reporting**: Custom report generation to refine business strategy and provide insights into operations.
- **Borrower Data Management Module**: A new feature aiming to centralize and enhance data handling related to borrowers, currently in the rollout phase.

**The Team and Support Structure**

Hypercore’s team comprises seven dedicated professionals, including Nicolas Dessaigne, who serves as a Group Partner. Their collective expertise in fintech, combined with practical insights from their military background, gives them a unique edge in navigating the lending market.

**Looking Forward**

As Hypercore scales its operations and refines its products, it remains committed to transforming how private lenders manage their loans. Their focus on automating processes and providing real-time analytics positions them as a forward-thinking player in the fintech sector.

### The Vision Behind Idemeum

Imagine a single platform where you can streamline employee access to all your apps without the hassle of multiple tools for SSO, password management, and access. That’s where Idemeum steps in. By integrating seamlessly with any HR system, Idemeum automates the onboarding process and account provisioning. Employees can use mobile device biometrics to log in to both free and paid applications, creating a frictionless user experience.

### What They Offer

Idemeum’s offerings revolve around three main products:
1. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Admin Access**: Compliant and secure, this eliminates the headaches of shared accounts by granting access only when it’s needed.
2. **Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM)**: It allows for admin account discovery, enhances local rights management, and streamlines user elevation requests, leveraging a powerful rule engine.
3. **RFID Single Sign-On**: A simple tap-and-go solution for accessing shared workstations and applications, making user authentication a breeze.

### Robust and Secure

The company's technology is grounded in a few key principles:
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Idemeum never sees your credentials; everything is encrypted client-side.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: It works across Windows, macOS, and Entra ID.
- **Easy Integrations**: Instant compatibility with various remote management and documentation tools ensures a seamless setup.

Founded in 2021 in Los Angeles, CA, Inversion Space is a dynamic startup on an ambitious mission: to create a transportation layer in space for delivery to Earth. This innovative firm emerged from Y Combinator’s Batch S21, reflecting its potential to disrupt traditional transportation methods much like the advent of aircraft did.

Inversion Space has assembled a savvy team of 28 employees, under the seasoned guidance of Group Partner Jared Friedman. The company emphasizes ""hard-tech"" and ""hardware"" in its operations, positioning itself at the intersection of aerospace and transportation. 

### What Do They Do?
Inversion Space is pioneering the development of autonomous re-entry vehicles designed to transport cargo directly from space back to Earth. Imagine a world where delivery happens in less than an hour from anywhere on the globe—a reality they’re striving to achieve with their flagship projects, Ray and Arc.

- **Ray**: Set to launch in October 2024, this capsule will focus on technology maturation with a four-week mission. It's all about integrating cutting-edge technology to prepare for broader applications.

- **Arc**: Slated for a 2026 launch, Arc aims to provide fully autonomous global delivery over a mission duration exceeding five years. Its specs are impressive—landing with an accuracy of less than 50 feet, making it viable for rapid deployment of goods.

### The Vision
Inversion Space envisions a landscape where space capabilities are leveraged for terrestrial benefits. Their approach distinguishes them from conventional space firms; their primary customers are down on Earth, tapping into pre-existing markets that are ready for disruption. By innovating cargo delivery via space, they aspire to position the U.S. at the forefront of this transformative frontier.

### Join the Journey
Inversion Space is on the lookout for passionate individuals eager to pioneer this electrifying intersection of transportation and aerospace. They are building the future, and as they say, ""come join us as we make space a transportation layer for Earth.""

### What They Do
At its core, Iona Mind leverages Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a proven, evidence-based treatment method backed by over 300 peer-reviewed studies. What sets Iona Mind apart from typical wellness apps is its automated delivery of CBT through a conversational interface, making it accessible and engaging for users.

Their offerings include tailored psychological support designed to meet the specific needs of diverse populations, including chronic disease sufferers and underrepresented groups. They’re not just building another app; they’re shaping scalable solutions that adapt to the individual, ensuring a more personalized approach to mental wellbeing.

### Why Iona Mind Stands Out
1. **Market Leadership**: They are at the forefront of low-intensity CBT technologies, which enable users to engage with therapeutic content at their own pace, reducing pressure on both patients and healthcare providers.

2. **24/7 Support**: Iona Mind offers around-the-clock access to their care team via their platform, ensuring immediate assistance for those in need.

3. **Co-Development**: Their products are crafted with direct input from users, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility right from concept to rollout.

### Global Recognition
Iona Mind isn't just a local player; they have established partnerships and initiatives globally, notably working with:
- The Carbone Cancer Center in Wisconsin to tailor CBT for cancer patients.
- Unum to enhance employee benefits with accessible psychological support.
- The Office for Veterans’ Affairs, adapting their platform to fit NHS England’s mental health model.

### Summary
In essence, Iona Mind represents a meaningful shift in mental health care, marrying technology with science to create accessible, efficient, and effective support mechanisms.

Think of them as a bridge between companies and law enforcement, helping to streamline often cumbersome processes like responding to subpoenas. 

The crux of the problem is familiar to many: when a government agency, say the FBI, requests user data, companies can find themselves tangled in a web of fragmented communications via email, fax, and, yes—spreadsheets. This manual approach exposes firms to compliance risks, potential data breaches, and costly delays. That’s where Kodex steps in.

Kodex provides a centralized, secure platform where companies can effortlessly manage these requests. The system validates the legitimacy of agents, automates workflows, protects user privacy, and generates real-time transparency reports—all while keeping sensitive information secure. Essentially, it's digitizing and refining what used to be a messy, error-prone process.

Today, Kodex boasts a team of around 30 employees and has built relationships with over 15,000 government agencies globally.

On average, kids engage with the app for 10-20 minutes outside of classroom time, underscoring its stickiness. The curriculum is firmly grounded in the Science of Reading, aligned with Common Core Standards, and aims to advance key skills like comprehension, vocabulary, phonics, and fluency.

**Community and Connectivity:**
Litnerd actively connects with schools and families, offering programs like the Young Authors Program that includes live assemblies, guided writing sessions, and real publishing opportunities for students. Over 14,000 students have already benefited from Litnerd in their classrooms, and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive—92% of kids reported that Litnerd made reading fun.

Their robust clinical trial, reviewed by the FDA, is currently underway at Northwestern University with further trials at Ohio State University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham. They hold several utility patents in the US, Europe, and Hong Kong, with more pending in Australia.

Liv Labs primarily revolves around their **K+ Training Intensive**, a comprehensive 21-day self-care program that combines:
- Three private online consultations with pelvic health experts
- Access to tailored exercise videos

The ongoing support helps participants address the underlying issues of continence while easily fitting into their daily routines—no invasive tests or clinic visits necessary.

Liv Labs also provides an array of resources, including product offerings and self-care literature, all directed at helping women manage their health confidently.

**Company Overview**
Founded in 2019 and located in Galway, Ireland, Luminate Medical is on a mission to mitigate the distress caused by cancer treatments. They're doing this by creating medical devices designed to prevent the harsh side effects of chemotherapy such as hair loss, neuropathy, and infertility. The company, which is a product of the Y Combinator Batch S21, has a team of 36 employees working to revolutionize cancer care.

**Core Products**
- **Lily:** This portable, wearable cap is a game-changer for chemotherapy patients, allowing them to prevent hair loss—a significant concern for many undergoing treatment.
  
- **Lilac:** This innovative device stands as the first of its kind aimed at preventing peripheral nerve damage (neuropathy) associated with cancer treatments, which is a leading cause of treatment discontinuation. 

**The Problem They Address**
Cancer treatment comes with a laundry list of unpleasant side effects. These often lead to treatment withdrawal, with up to 28% of patients in antibody-drug conjugate trials ceasing due to neuropathy. For many, hair loss is not just a minor inconvenience—it's one of the most traumatic parts of their experience with cancer.

**Vision for the Future**
Luminate Medical isn't just about existing products. They’re exploring more ways to enhance patients' quality of life through research into conditions like lymphedema and post-treatment fertility issues. Their ultimate vision is to transform cancer care, enabling therapies to be administered at home, thereby making it more accessible and comfortable for patients.

**Why It Matters**
The financial burden of cancer care is staggering, with Medicare spending significantly more on treatment services than on therapeutic costs.

#### Why It Matters

In today’s fast-paced world, the ability to instantly transform large datasets into actionable insights isn't just nice to have—it’s essential. Mach9 is shaking up the surveying, engineering, and construction industries by drastically reducing the time and labor needed for mapping and model generation. The company is already trusted by major organizations like the U.S. Department of Energy, Michael Baker International, and various engineering firms around the globe.

#### Getting Started with Mach9

Interested in what Mach9 offers? Getting started is simple:
1. Fill out a project request form.
2. Schedule an onboarding session with a technical expert.
3. Review your processed Mach9 map and iterate as needed through user-friendly prompts.

#### The Bigger Picture

Mach9 isn't just about speed; it’s about enabling organizations to leverage their data effectively and efficiently. As cities grow and infrastructure demand increases, firms need advanced tools to process geospatial data without losing sight of their goals. The promise of Mach9 is to take that burden off their plates, letting them concentrate on executing their vision.

**Overview**

Founded in 2021 and a proud member of Y Combinator’s Batch S21, Meticulous is a London-based startup that’s transforming how we think about user interface (UI) testing. With a compact team of five employees, they've developed a powerful tool designed to automate end-to-end screenshot testing without the cumbersome need to write or maintain tests. You can check them out at [Meticulous AI](https://www.meticulous.ai).

**Mission**

Meticulous aims to eliminate the burden of setup and maintenance associated with traditional UI testing methods. Simply by installing a JavaScript snippet in your production or staging environments, you can start capturing user sessions including clickstream and network data. As developers work and push changes, Meticulous intelligently selects and simulates a representative subset of user sessions. The tool automatically generates screenshots at critical points in user interactions to identify visual discrepancies, enabling teams to catch bugs before they reach production.

**How It Works**

1. **Session Recording**: Add a script tag to start recording sessions wherever your application is being developed.
   
2. **AI-Driven Test Generation**: Meticulous uses advanced AI to create a comprehensive suite of visual tests that cover every nook and cranny of your application. 

3. **Pull Request Impact Analysis**: Before merging a pull request, Meticulous provides detailed insights on how changes will affect user workflows, helping to avoid potential regressions.

4. **Continuous Evolution of Tests**: As your application evolves, so does your test suite. New tests are generated automatically with new features while outdated tests are seamlessly retired, requiring zero intervention from developers.

5. **Speed and Reliability**: Meticulous runs tests in a highly parallelized fashion across a compute cluster, getting results for thousands of screens in less than two minutes. It combats flaky tests by employing deterministic scheduling, ensuring consistency and stability in how tests perform.

**Trusted by Many**

Over 100 organizations already trust Meticulous, including known names like Dropbox and Lattice. Users have praised its capacity to catch UI bugs without the overhead of manual test maintenance, allowing teams to move faster with confidence.

**Conclusion**

Meticulous is positioning itself as a game-changer in the DevTools landscape. With its revolutionary approach to UI testing, it is empowering teams to focus on what really matters—building great products without the logistical headaches of traditional testing. So, if you're looking to elevate your development process, Meticulous offers a compelling solution to enhance productivity and reliability.

Momo Medical, founded in 2017 and based in San Francisco, is on a mission: to help nurses in nursing homes become 30% more efficient. This is not just about numbers; it’s about enhancing the quality of care for residents who need it most. 

Initially, Momo Medical hit the ground running with a smart solution—a bed sensor that connects to the internet and is placed under the mattresses in nursing homes. Their innovative app provides invaluable insights, enabling nurses to have a clearer overview of all residents. By reducing incidents like falls and bedsores, Momo Medical has managed to boost the nighttime productivity of nursing staff significantly.

### The Problem They Solve

The healthcare sector, particularly in nursing homes, faces critical challenges—most notably, staff shortages. Momo Medical steps in to tackle these issues head-on. By equipping nursing homes with advanced technology, they not only enhance the efficiency of existing staff but also raise the standards of care. The results speak for themselves: facilities using Momo Medical’s technology experience a notable drop in emergencies and an increase in the quality of life of their residents.

### The Team and Backing

With a lean team of about 10 passionate individuals, Momo Medical is partially supported by Y Combinator's Batch S21, giving them access to a powerful network and resources. They are also tagged as a SaaS (Software as a Service), IoT (Internet of Things), and B2B (Business to Business) company, reflecting their product’s nature and market.

### Why it Works

So, what makes Momo Medical's approach so effective? Firstly, the **Momo BedSense App** lets caregivers monitor who is getting out of bed, how residents are doing at any given time, and alerts them to any unusual inactivity. It's a shift from traditional rounds to a more personalized care model. The app has been touted for bringing peace of mind to caregivers, who maintain an overview of their entire department effortlessly.

**Key Benefits Include:**
- **Reduced fall incidents**: Alerts caregivers before a resident gets out of bed, allowing for timely intervention.
- **Improved rest for residents**: More personalized care leads to better sleep quality.
- **Enhanced job satisfaction**: Not only do staff members find their workloads lightened, but they also feel more competent in providing high-quality care.

### Real Stories, Real Impact

The feedback from caregivers and family members has been overwhelmingly positive. Nurses report feeling more at ease knowing they can oversee numerous residents at once, while family members appreciate the added safety for their loved ones. The heartfelt reflections highlight not just a better workflow but a deeper emotional connection to the care provided.

### Looking Ahead

As Momo Medical continues to grow, they focus on improving the lives of residents while supporting the hardworking staff in nursing homes. If you're curious to experience the Momo BedSense yourself, they offer the opportunity to trial the system for three months, providing hands-on guidance throughout.

Welcome to Outloud.ai, where we’re on a mission to build the Gong.io for offline retail, specifically targeting drive-thru restaurants. Launched in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's S21 batch, we’ve set up our base in sunny Miami, FL, with an ambitious team of five. 

**What We Do**
Outloud.ai started by recording and analyzing customer conversations during drive-thru orders. This isn't just eavesdropping—we provide actionable insights that help restaurant operators upsell more effectively and get real-time alerts for stock shortages. In our quest for operational excellence, we’ve managed to process over 40 million orders across hundreds of restaurants.

**Key Features**
- **Custom Large Language Models (LLMs)**: We’ve fine-tuned AI models to pick up on crucial operational issues—like stores struggling to take orders or running low on products.
- **Upselling Intelligence**: Our technology identifies the right moments for upselling, helping to boost revenue by as much as 15%.
- **Voice AI for Speed**: We’ve trained our models on hundreds of thousands of hours of data, enabling restaurants to reduce their service time to under three minutes.
  
**The Impact**
On a daily basis, we process around 100,000 orders. Our clients report a staggering increase of $75,000 in gross profits per store. We currently operate in over 20 states, enabling transparency across the front lines of their businesses.

Our users can't stop raving about how Outloud.ai has transformed their operations. As Tanvir, a VP of Tech at a 400+ store chain says, ""With Outloud, front-line teams are able to provide much better service,"" creating a win-win for everyone involved.

**Get Involved**
Curious about how we can help your business? Request a demo on our website [Outloud.ai](https://www.outloud.ai/), and join the movement toward smarter, data-driven drive-thrus. 

In a nutshell, Outloud.ai is about harnessing the power of machine learning to not just keep up with the fast pace of the food service industry but to stay ahead. Let’s make fast food faster and more profitable together.

Pandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. 

Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses.

🔥 Why do we build this? 

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

👨‍🏫 Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

🚀 Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students.

Founded in 2021 as part of Y Combinator's Summer 2021 Batch, its mission is straightforward yet profound: to use the human immune system to cure diseases, creating a future where therapies are not just potent but also rely on ethical, accurate science.

The founders, Robert DiFazio and Juliana Hilliard, bring deep expertise in immunology and bioengineering to the table. They initially developed a platform that mimics the human immune system within a lab setting—a ""human immune system in a dish."" This innovative approach addresses a critical flaw in traditional drug testing: the reliance on animal models, primarily mice, which often fail to predict human responses accurately. In fact, 95% of drugs that undergo animal testing never make it to market, costing the pharmaceutical industry billions and wasting years of research.

Parallel Bio’s platform allows for early-stage testing of drugs and vaccines that resemble actual human responses. This means that pharmaceutical companies can gain insights into which therapies are likely to succeed in human patients without the lengthy and expensive preclinical trials. So far, they have successfully tested 12 drugs and vaccines targeting eight different diseases.

This technology enables testing drugs in a fully ethical manner, without the need for animal models, ultimately enhancing the safety and efficacy of new therapies. The integration of artificial intelligence into this process further amplifies their ability to discover novel drug candidates swiftly.

With a lean team of nine, supported by Jared Friedman from Y Combinator, Parallel Bio is poised to transform the landscape of immunotherapy and drug development. Their ultimate aim? To accelerate the availability of effective, accessible medications for diverse populations around the world, ensuring a healthier future for everyone.

Imagine a world stripped of chocolate. Scary, right? That’s where Planet A Foods comes in. Founded in 2021 and nestled in Munich, Germany, this innovative startup aims to redefine how we think about chocolate and, ultimately, food ingredients. It’s part of Y Combinator Batch S21, indicating that its potential hasn’t gone unnoticed.

The mission is straightforward yet ambitious: **to build the next generation food ingredient champion**. With cocoa supplies dwindling and its production impacting our planet negatively, Planet A Foods is using **precision fermentation** to create sustainable chocolate alternatives that boast not just improved sustainability but also a lower price point—10 times more sustainable and 20% cheaper than traditional chocolate.

Each day, a staggering 55 million pounds of chocolate are consumed globally. By 2035, this company aims to capture a significant share of that market with their eco-friendly chocolate substitute, maintaining the familiar taste and mouthfeel we love, while ensuring that we aren’t harming the environment in the process. They’re not stopping at chocolate either; the tech driving their innovations will soon extend to other ingredients like palm oil.

The founders highlight a troubling reality—growing demand for cocoa has led to widespread deforestation and increased carbon emissions, particularly in countries like Ghana. In fact, from 2000 to 2021, Ghana lost around 1.4 million hectares of tree cover, emitting a whopping 739 million tons of CO2 in the process. But Planet A Foods isn’t just about creating delicious alternatives; they aim to save **500 million tons of CO2 annually** by producing ingredients that don’t rely on limited natural resources and labor exploitation.

Founded in 2021 and based in Boston, Promakhos Therapeutics is on a mission to revolutionize the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Their approach is refreshing and bold; instead of just suppressing the immune system—which is the standard method for treating chronic inflammatory diseases today—they aim to restore its inherent ability to regulate inflammation and facilitate healing.

### The Beginning and Future Directions

Initially, Promakhos began by focusing on leveraging bacterial molecules to enhance the body’s innate immune response. Their first target? Crohn's disease, which carries a staggering annual treatment cost of around $10 billion in the U.S. Following Crohn's, they plan to tackle type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis—conditions that also stem from immune system dysregulation.

### A Small but Mighty Team

With a compact team of just two full-time employees, Promakhos is powered by the vision of Co-founders **Katerina Chatzi, Ph.D.**, and **Jasper E. Neggers, Ph.D.** Both bring extensive backgrounds in biology and immunology, complemented by their entrepreneurial spirit. Their impressive track records include postdoctoral work at prestigious institutions like Harvard University and KU Leuven, where they honed their expertise in research, business development, and drug discovery.

### Innovative Therapeutics Platform

Promakhos is not just another biotech company. They're developing a unique therapeutics platform that centers on treating the root causes of inflammatory diseases—an approach that very few in the industry are taking. Instead of simply managing symptoms, they aim to fundamentally change how chronic inflammation is addressed. As they grow, their platform may become a pivotal part of modern medicine in managing autoimmune conditions.

### Awards and Recognition

Recognizing its innovative approach and potential impact, Promakhos has garnered attention from organizations like Y Combinator and the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center. Their recent achievements include winning the **Massachusetts Next Generation Initiative Award**, awarded to women-led startups that show promise. They also received a **$272,000 NIH Phase 1 SBIR grant** to develop an oral immunomodulating therapy specifically focusing on Crohn's disease.

### Future Aspirations

Promakhos Therapeutics is clearly on the rise, combining scientific innovation with strategic foresight to create therapies that could alleviate the burden of chronic diseases affecting millions. Their mission aligns well with modern healthcare's need for effective solutions that prioritize restoring rather than suppressing our bodies' natural functions.

In short, if you’re looking at the biotech landscape through the lens of inflammation and autoimmunity, keep your eyes on Promakhos Therapeutics. They might just be the game-changer we've all been waiting for.

At Protex AI, we’re on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.

🤕 The Problem:
Keeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.

Serious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.

✅ Problem Solved:
Protex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.

The platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.

Protex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.

HS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.

Founded in 2020 and a member of Y Combinator's S21 batch, Protex AI focuses on transforming how health and safety (EHS) teams identify and manage risks.

### The Challenge

Workplace safety is a daunting task, especially in high-risk industries like manufacturing and logistics. In the U.S., over 5,000 workplace fatalities occurred in 2019, and injuries cost businesses a staggering $62 billion annually. Most safety measures have been reactive—waiting for incidents to happen before acting.

### The Solution

Protex AI is flipping the script with their innovative platform that acts as a digital guardian angel, using existing CCTV infrastructure to monitor safety compliance in real-time. Their software helps EHS teams translate documentation into actionable insights, automatically auditing facilities for safety risks and compliance issues. This data can be used during safety meetings, audits, and discussions about insurance claims.

### Key Features

1. **Seamless Integration:** The platform easily integrates with existing camera systems, allowing companies to utilize their current infrastructure without extensive investment.
   
2. **Customizable Safety Rules:** EHS teams can tailor safety rules and reporting dashboards to fit unique workplace needs.

3. **Real-Time Insights:** The system provides actionable intelligence on unsafe behaviors and incidents, enabling proactive adjustments to safety protocols.

4. **Empowered Decision-Making:** Through intuitive reporting tools and a Gen-AI feature called Copilot, teams can swiftly identify issues and take corrective actions.

### Impact and Results

Protex AI has demonstrated impressive results with their clients. For example, Marks and Spencer saw an 80% reduction in overall incidents within the first 10 weeks of deploying the system, while a global food distributor reduced area control risks by 76%.

### The Future

As Protex AI continues to expand and refine their offering—having recently secured $36M in Series B funding—they are poised to make substantial waves in the industrial workplace safety sector. Their vision of a safer workplace aligns seamlessly with the increasing need for proactive safety measures in industries where hazards are prevalent.

Founded in 2020 and based in Santiago, Chile, RendaloMaq has carved out a niche in the equipment rental market, aiming to be the backbone of construction throughout Latin America. Think of them as the modern-day 'picks and shovels' for construction projects, leveraging cloud technology to upgrade traditional equipment rental practices. They participated in Y Combinator's Batch S21, which speaks volumes about their potential and the innovative approach they’re bringing to the industry.

With a team of around 30 employees, they are not just about renting equipment; they’re about reshaping how businesses view machinery access. In a region where construction is booming but often hampered by logistics and inefficiencies, RendaloMaq steps in to simplify the process—think an Uber for construction equipment.

Their mission is pretty straightforward: offer tech-enabled equipment rentals that streamline the process for construction businesses in Latin America. They provide an extensive range of machinery for rent, including:

- Scissor lifts
- Articulated booms
- Earth-moving equipment
- Telescopic booms
- Trucks
- Material handling units

These offerings make it easier for companies to find the equipment they need, when they need it, all from the comfort of their devices. Their website offers a seamless quoting system, which is essential for busy professionals who can't afford downtime.

RendaloMaq is quickly gaining traction. They boast over 800 satisfied clients and have partnered with more than 450 suppliers, managing a vast inventory of over 5,000 machines. These figures not only highlight their operational scale but also underscore their credibility in the marketplace.

Bridging technology and equipment rental puts RendaloMaq at the forefront of a crucial sector. Their approach not only caters to construction firms but also provides opportunities for individual suppliers to rent or sell their equipment through the platform, thus capturing value from both ends of the equation.

Brad Flora serves as a group partner, bringing additional leadership and experience to their operations. This is a company to watch as Latin America continues to grow.

Founded in 2020 and proudly part of Y Combinator's S21 batch, REPROSENT is a forward-thinking company based in Los Gatos, CA, on a bold mission: to empower patients as a vital resource in their healthcare journey. With a small but passionate team of four, including Founder & CEO Aimee DeGolyer, REPROSENT offers a unique patient-driven care system designed to alleviate the strain on overburdened medical teams.

**The Problem: Underutilized Patient Time**
Despite having around 720 hours in a month, patients often spend less than one hour with their doctors. This disparity creates a missed opportunity for meaningful communication and understanding. REPROSENT steps in to optimize that time, turning patients into key players in their treatment process.

**Transforming Healthcare Through Actionable Data**
The foundation of REPROSENT’s approach is a smart app that integrates patients and their loved ones into the care process. Patients can track their symptoms, capture their experiences, and receive timely triage advice. This not only aids in managing their health but also provides healthcare professionals with actionable insights to offer tailored treatments.

- **Stay On Track**: REPROSENT ensures patients receive critical reminders and instructions, enhancing safety and compliance during recovery.
- **Data-Driven Understanding**: By allowing patients to record their lived experiences in real-time, the app helps them articulate their symptoms accurately, which can significantly influence care decisions.
- **Broadening Support Networks**: The platform includes two app experiences—one for the patient and another for a loved one—encouraging family engagement in the care process.
- **Maximizing Doctor Visits**: With better preparation, patients can arrive at appointments equipped with data-driven reports that facilitate richer discussions with their healthcare providers.

**A Personal Touch**
REPROSENT's inception stems from a deeply personal experience. Founder Aimee DeGolyer lost her father to a preventable adverse reaction during cancer treatment, fueling her drive to enhance patient engagement in healthcare. This personalized commitment signifies REPROSENT’s ethos: transforming the way medical care is delivered to foster better outcomes.

**The Vision Ahead**
REPROSENT's mission aligns perfectly with today's healthcare landscape, where efficiency meets empathetic care. With ongoing backing from investors like Y Combinator, Bond Capital, and Harvard, the company is poised for substantial growth in the digital health sector, especially within oncology and consumer health services.

Founded in 2019 and a proud participant of Y Combinator’s S21 batch, Revolve has developed the world's first surgical robot designed specifically for the diverse requirements of different operating environments.

Their unique surgical robotics platform, built with input from over 50 surgeons, is not just notable for its impressive efficacy but also for its compactness and cost-efficiency—it measures at only 1% of the size and expense of existing robotic systems. This makes it a game-changer, especially given that over 1 million abdominal surgeries in the U.S. are performed outside hospitals each year.

Based in Toronto, Canada, Revolve's small team of eight is powered by a vision that healthcare should be accessible and affordable for all. Their product is designed to seamlessly fit into independent outpatient centers as well as sprawling national health networks, essentially bringing advanced surgical capability to places where it's previously been out of reach.

Some key highlights of their technology include:
- **5mm wristed instruments** that allow for remarkable dexterity while maintaining a minimal incision size.
- A **zero-footprint design** that can be mounted directly to the operating table, making it suitable for even the smallest ORs.
- A **digital-first approach** that incorporates enhanced visualization, data analytics, and AI from the ground up.

Their focus isn’t merely on hardware but on elevating the standard of surgical care globally. As they continue to innovate, they’re bent on ensuring that the sophistication of robotic surgery isn't limited to the elite settings but is accessible to the masses, fundamentally transforming the landscape of surgical care.

Founded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's Summer 2021 batch, ShipBlu is based in Cairo, Egypt, and is on a mission to revolutionize logistics for eCommerce in the MENA region. The founders recognized that many delivery providers were still stuck in the Dark Ages, relying on outdated methods like pen and paper to handle operations. This inefficiency resulted in five times the failed deliveries and tripled operating costs compared to global standards. Clearly, something had to change.

**What ShipBlu Does**

ShipBlu aims to bring Amazon-level logistics to the fast-growing eCommerce landscape in MENA, where the market is expanding rapidly. With a keen understanding of the local environment and a vision for efficiency, they've built a comprehensive logistics infrastructure that addresses every aspect of delivery and fulfillment. 

At the core of ShipBlu's operational efficiency is their proprietary ShipBlu AutoPilot—a cutting-edge suite of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms. This technology not only predicts and makes operational decisions but also works tirelessly to lower costs, adhere to delivery timelines, and streamline their operational strategies. This tech-driven approach is highlighted by the expertise of their CTO, Abdelrahman, who is deep into a PhD at Brown University, focusing on the practical applications of AI and ML in optimizations.

**Rapid Growth and Future Prospects**

ShipBlu has made remarkable strides since launching operations on August 1, 2021, establishing a nationwide delivery network in Egypt in just 2.5 months. Within weeks, they secured over 40 merchants to partner with, anticipating revenues of over $40k in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) when these merchants fully roll out operations by October.

With a growing team of 300 employees, ShipBlu is positioning itself as a key player in the eCommerce logistics space within MENA. Their unique blend of innovative technology and an understanding of local needs has the potential to reshape how deliveries are managed in the region.

Founded in 2017 and part of Y Combinator’s S21 batch, Stipop began its journey as a sticker repository hosting 5,000 creators and over 250,000 stickers, providing stickers for major platforms like Canva, Teams, Google, and Adobe. Now, it's evolved into a comprehensive monetization platform that allows indie character creators to connect directly with their fans.

### What They Do

At its core, Stipop connects creators with their audience through dynamic tools for monetization. Creators can turn their characters into digital stickers, wallpapers, and even watch faces, allowing their fans to engage with their content in fun, interactive ways. This innovative approach not only enhances fan engagement but also streamlines the revenue generation process for artists, who can offer subscriptions and one-time purchases without hefty upfront costs. Stipop only takes a 10% cut of revenues once creators start making money, ensuring it's a low-risk way to kickstart a revenue-generating venture.

### Technology Backbone

For developers and chat platforms, Stipop also provides robust APIs and SDKs to integrate stickers seamlessly into messaging apps. This is crucial in today’s communication landscape, where personalized expression through stickers is becoming increasingly popular.

### Team and Backers

Operating from Santa Monica, California, with a team of just eight employees, Stipop has garnered significant support from prominent investors like Snap (through Yellow Accelerator), Y Combinator, and various venture capital firms. This backing illustrates the growing recognition of the demand for platforms that cater to character creators in a digital world.

### Community and Feedback

The feedback from creators has been overwhelmingly positive; they appreciate Stipop’s flexibility, user-friendly model, and the platform’s emphasis on community-building. Testimonials highlight that Stipop reduces technical hurdles, making it easier for creators to distribute their work across multiple messaging platforms. Creators are happy with the control they retain over their content, ensuring they own everything they upload and can build a community around their work.

### Why It Matters

In an era where digital communication relies heavily on expressive visuals, Stipop is carving out a niche that acknowledges and rewards artistic creators. By creating a monetization-friendly environment, it not only helps artists earn a living doing what they love but enriches the digital landscape with unique character-driven content.

StrideQ, formerly known as SliceQ, is on a mission to revolutionize the restaurant industry with its automated phone ordering system. Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Summer Batch S21, this tech startup operates from Mountain View, California, with a lean team of just two employees. The idea is simple yet powerful: ensure that no phone orders are missed, thus safeguarding restaurant revenue—a concern given that 33% of customers still prefer calling in their orders.

### The Problem and the Solution

During peak hours, restaurant front desks often become bottlenecks. Staff are busy handling in-person customers, which leads to missed orders and lost revenue. StrideQ addresses this by automating the phone ordering process. Customers who have implemented StrideQ have seen sales increases of over 10%, even amid staff shortages exacerbated by COVID-19.

But StrideQ isn't just about preventing missed calls; it's a wedge to becoming the central point-of-sale (POS) system for restaurants. The software seamlessly integrates dine-in and online orders, making operations more manageable, especially during busy periods.

### Key Benefits

1. **Increased Efficiency:** StrideQ reduces the time staff spend answering phone calls, allowing them to focus on in-person guests and other critical tasks.
   
2. **Boosted Revenue:** Users report a significant uptick in orders and tips—between 10-20%—as it minimizes customer wait times and captures more phone orders.
   
3. **Staffing Solution:** The platform can save restaurants over two hours a day previously spent on phone calls, leading to a 20-30% decrease in labor costs.
   
4. **AI-Powered Catering Tools:** StrideQ features custom inquiry forms and a catering management system, allowing restaurants to effectively capture and manage catering orders.

5. **Effortless Onboarding:** Installation is swift—no hardware is required, and the current phone system can be retained. Onboarding takes just about 20 minutes, with no training necessary for staff.

### Customer Testimonials

Francisco Rodriguez from Las Vegas Taqueria noted, “I no longer need a dedicated person to attend phone calls... now that person helps with packaging and assisting dine-in customers. StrideQ solved my hiring issues.” 

Kaori Watanabe of Seto Restaurant shared, “With StrideQ, my revenue increased by 20%. The chaos of lunch hours is gone.”

### The Bigger Picture

StrideQ is aiming high. By optimizing the phone ordering process, they intend to expand their offering into a complete POS solution for restaurants. This aligns perfectly with the ongoing trend in technology where operational efficiency meets customer service excellence.

### What’s the Problem?

Healthcare is an essential part of our lives, yet it is riddled with inefficiencies.

This inefficiency not only hampers healthcare quality but also contributes to soaring operational costs. It's worth noting that salaries represent a staggering **$800 billion** in annual spending by U.S. healthcare organizations—that's a big chunk of change wasted!

Enter *Sully.ai's* solution—a comprehensive AI-driven platform designed specifically to save doctors time before, during, and after patient consultations. The core product is an **all-in-one solution** tailored to enhance physician productivity, allowing them to focus on patient care instead of paperwork.

### Target Market

The primary customer base for Sully.ai is **healthcare organizations**. With an annual total of over **1 billion patient visits** in the U.S. alone and the average visit costing **$300**, the market potential is enormous. If Sully.ai's Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) doctors can lower these costs to about **$29 per visit**, that translates to **$3.9 billion** in revenue just within the U.S., with a global market projection exceeding **$25 billion**.

### Features and Offerings 

Sully.ai offers a range of **AI agents** that handle various tasks, including:

- **Medical Assistant:** Supports clinical procedures.

- **Receptionist Agent:** Manages patient appointments.

- **Pharmacy Technician:** Procures medication orders.
- **Medical Coder:** Assigns the correct billing codes.
  
What’s compelling about these AI agents is their ability to integrate seamlessly into existing healthcare systems, making the transition smooth for healthcare providers.

Founded in 2020 and located in Seattle, WA, Talus Bio is at the forefront of biotechnology, specifically focused on drug discovery that targets the DNA regulome—essentially, the regulatory elements of our genome. With a mission to reinvent how we approach “undruggable” genomic regulators, Talus Bio has effectively moved drug discovery from artificial environments back into living human cells. This method ensures that the functions of regulome proteins are accurately assessed, enabling a deeper understanding of how drugs can modify their actions.

**Technology and Innovations**

Talus Bio has developed an impressive platform called MARMOT, which stands out for its ability to target previously ""undruggable"" transcription factors in their native cellular contexts. By combining cutting-edge automated cell processing, next-gen proteomics, and advanced data analytics, the platform can evaluate a drug's impact on the entire regulome within a single experiment. This is particularly significant for addressing complex diseases like cancer and diabetes, where therapeutic options are often limited.

**Team and Ecosystem**

The Talus Bio team consists of 16 employees who are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of drug development in challenging therapeutic areas. They were also a part of the Y Combinator Batch S21, which is a testament to their innovative approach and potential for growth. Jared Friedman serves as their Group Partner, providing strategic guidance.

**Current Initiatives and Community Engagement**

On their website, you can explore various sections detailing their technology, research pipeline, and recent publications. They also share updates on staffing changes and new initiatives, including a blog that addresses drugging the undruggable. By fostering a culture of openness and innovation, Talus Bio aims to bridge gaps in the healthcare landscape, so no target feels insurmountable.

Founded in 2017 and hailing from Jakarta, Indonesia, **Titipku** is carving out a niche as a super hyperlocal marketplace designed specifically for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the country's vibrant grocery sector. Initially rooted in the classic traditional wet market model—where anywhere between 200 to 1,000 merchants sell groceries in every neighborhood—Titipku is digitizing this entire ecosystem. Essentially, they are bringing old-school market shopping into the modern digital era.

Here’s how it works: through the Titipku app, households can conveniently shop from various merchants within a local market, placing single orders for groceries sourced from multiple sellers. It’s a powerful concept when you consider there are 16,000 local markets across Indonesia, hosting around 8 million merchants. Titipku is tapping into a massive and often underrepresented segment of the retail market.

As a graduate of Y Combinator's S21 batch, Titipku has the guidance of industry leaders, including their group partner, Gustaf Alstromer. Growth is tangible, with a dedicated team of 19 employees driving operations and customer engagement.

What makes Titipku particularly appealing is its clear commitment to both consumer convenience and support for local entrepreneurs. The platform guarantees fresh products, offers free shipping, and ensures a vast selection with over 900,000 product choices from 6,000 different stalls. You can even schedule your delivery to suit your needs—a feature that adds a level of flexibility apparently rare in traditional grocery shopping.

The testimonials from users, including notable Indonesian figures, spotlight the positive impact of Titipku. Customers appreciate the practicality of being able to shop from multiple vendors in one go, receiving fresh products, and ultimately supporting local businesses going digital. 

Titipku is not just another delivery app; it's a platform that acknowledges the value of community interaction in shopping. In supporting local merchants, the company is also fostering the digital growth of Indonesia’s SME sector. 

You can explore their offerings by visiting [Titipku’s website](https://titipku.com).

Founded in 2016 and part of Y Combinator's Summer 2021 batch, TransAstra Corporation is a forward-thinking company based in Los Angeles, California. Its mission revolves around **orbital logistics**, focusing on the bold idea of expanding human presence in space, particularly to asteroids. With the belief that asteroids hold the key to sustainable resources for humanity, TransAstra is working to harness these celestial bodies to support life beyond Earth.

### Innovative Technology

TransAstra stands out for its cutting-edge technology and robust patent portfolio—five patents issued and many more pending. One of their marquee inventions is the **Omnivore propulsion system**. This system utilizes concentrated sunlight to power spacecraft using water or various other fluids as propellant. It's touted as a revolutionary alternative to traditional propulsion systems, bringing advantages such as faster operation and drastically lower costs.

Another notable product is the **Sutter Telescope System**. Named after the site of California's gold rush, this technology is designed to identify resource-rich asteroids and track orbital debris—objects that current technologies have a hard time detecting. This capability is particularly crucial for national defense, as the Sutter can identify fast-moving, dark objects that threaten safety between Earth and the Moon.

### Growing the Space Economy

With over $5 million in revenue and a team of eight employees, TransAstra is already making notable strides in the burgeoning space economy. The company operates on four crucial capabilities in asteroid mining: **Detect, Move, Capture, and Process**. Each capability is geared towards meeting both government and commercial needs, ensuring that TransAstra is well-positioned to lead in this frontier.

The company is gaining traction, having already tracked dozens of moving objects in space, and is gearing up for the commercial launch of its Sutter data services.

### The Outlook

TransAstra's founder, Dr. Joel Sercel, emphasizes the importance of **mindset** in advancing economic potential beyond Earth. He believes that fostering an optimistic vision for the future—a belief in resource abundance in space—will be fundamental to humanity's success in developing sustainable livelihoods beyond our planet.

As we continue to explore the possibilities of space, TransAstra Corporation is right at the frontier, aiming to enable not just exploration, but a thriving presence in the cosmos.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from Lusaka, Zambia, Union54 is a Y Combinator-backed startup on a mission to revolutionize how money moves across borders in Africa. At its core, Union54 develops ChitChat—an integrated messaging and payments platform tailored to the unique financial landscape of the continent. The founders are tackling one of the most pressing challenges in Africa: exorbitant remittance fees that often burden senders with costs twice as high as necessary. 

**The Vision Behind Union54**

The vision is clear: create a seamless blend of secure instant messaging and payment capabilities that cater specifically to African users. With ChitChat, the app not only allows users to exchange messages but also empowers them to manage their finances with features like a USD wallet and the ability to transfer funds across ~50 countries. This makes international money movement more accessible and dials down the often-overwhelming costs traditionally associated with remittances.

Union54’s product suite extends far beyond ChitChat. Alongside the consumer app, they offer GovChat—a secure chat and payment platform designed specifically for governmental use, ensuring that sensitive communications remain confidential. Additionally, their ChitChat API provides businesses the flexibility to build their own messaging applications with integrated wallet functionality, all while leveraging Union54’s robust infrastructure.

**Building Digital Sovereignty**

Thus, the mission isn’t just about payments; it's about fostering digital sovereignty. Union54 envisions a future where both civilians and governments have the tools to engage in secure, meaningful discussions and transactions without fear of external interference. These goals are particularly crucial in socio-political climates experiencing instability.

**The Team and Backing**

With a team of 17 passionate individuals, Union54 is poised to make a significant impact. Their partnership with Y Combinator comes with not just funding but mentorship that accelerates their growth and enhances their strategic direction. Their ethos is centered around genuine service to customer needs, setting them apart from traditional players in the remittance space.

Founded in 2021 and an alumnus of Y Combinator Batch S21, Vansec is a startup taking aim at one of cybersecurity's most insidious threats: spear phishing. Based in New York, this nimble company is made up of a tight-knit team of two, passionately working to revolutionize how organizations tackle phishing threats through their innovative security training platform.

**What Do They Do?**

Vansec offers a sophisticated phishing simulation and security training platform, all powered by AI. Their mission? To stress-test organizations against social engineering tactics while enhancing security awareness among employees. With a focus on hyper-personalization and realism, Vansec's platform provides tailored phishing simulations that mimic real-world threats, ensuring that every employee gets a training experience specific to their needs and role.

**Their Core Products:**

1. **Vansec Simulation**: This feature employs a patent-pending multi-message AI-driven approach to spear phishing simulations. It's not just about one-off emails; Vansec engages users through a series of interactive communications, crafting scenarios that reflect actual attack methods. The result? A realistic and effective way to gauge and improve an organization's security posture.

2. **Vansec Training**: This isn’t your average training module. Meet ""Alan,"" the AI cybersecurity coach that guides employees through bite-sized, conversational lessons. Alan’s interactions are personalized and relevant, ensuring that every user walks away with knowledge that sticks after simulations are completed.

**Why It Matters?**

The landscape of cyber threats is evolving faster than many organizations can keep up. With a staggering 90% of security breaches beginning with phishing attempts, and a significant number of successful breaches attributed to spear phishing, the need for smart, effective training has never been clearer. Vansec stands at the forefront, not just offering any training, but one that's tailored to the users, dynamically adjusted according to their particular vulnerabilities.

**The Bigger Picture**

Through services grounded in AI and a user-centric approach, Vansec targets a broad spectrum of issues—from CEO fraud and business email compromise to the more modern threats such as smishing and deepfakes. Their goal is to equip companies with the defenses they need in a world that’s growing increasingly hostile to data integrity and security.

In a nutshell, Vansec is not just about preventing the next phishing attempt. They're about fostering a culture of security awareness and resilience within organizations. If you're looking to strengthen your defenses against social engineering attacks, give Vansec a closer look. They might just be the partner you need to stay one step ahead of cyber threats.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from Singapore, Warpfy is on a mission to reshape the $800 billion home and kitchen market with a tech-driven model that cuts out intermediaries. Think of them as the Shein or Williams Sonoma for home goods, but with a strong twist of Indian manufacturing flair. Initially known as The Fine Living Company, they aim to make “Made in India” not just a label, but a powerful global brand.

### What's the Problem?

The home and kitchen sector is fragmented, with over 70% of it dominated by single-store boutiques and online shopping barely reaching 20% penetration. That leaves a massive opportunity for disruption, particularly when you consider that more than 60% of the product value is lost to middlemen. Warpfy's direct-to-consumer (D2C) approach, coupled with marketplace sales and their proprietary B2B channel—the India Wholesale Company—means consumers can access high-quality goods at better prices.

### How Do They Operate?

Warpfy employs a robust ""Design-to-Manufacture-to-Consumer"" model. They use AI to streamline product design, manage enterprise resources for multi-channel distribution, and optimize the supply chain to deliver exceptional speed and value. This full-stack approach allows them to launch new products quickly, boasting an impressive 80% success rate for new releases, with 25% leading to significant scaling.

### Their Product Range

The company offers a diverse array of products within the home and kitchen realm—everything from organizers and kitchen essentials to home decor and bath organizers. Each product is thoughtfully designed, merging innovation with functionality, ensuring that customers get impeccable quality and durability.

### Industry Position & Future Plans

Warpfy is strategically positioned to tap into lucrative markets such as the USA, Canada, and the UK, establishing offices across various regions. This global outreach is supported by in-house design capabilities and expertise in cross-border trade, allowing them to sidestep traditional dealer networks and deliver directly to consumers.

### The Team and Vision

Operating with a compact team of three and supported by Y Combinator (Batch S21), Warpfy's vision is clear: to make a significant mark in the home lifestyle sector, transforming it with technology and streamlined processes. They are backed by investors who believe in their journey, including notable names in the startup ecosystem.

### Conclusion

Warpfy is poised to disrupt the home goods market in a big way. With a compelling value proposition that merges quality with affordability—without the clutter of middlemen—they're crafting a new narrative for Indian products on the global stage. If you're looking for stylish, functional home solutions, Warpfy is definitely a name to keep an eye on.

**Mission**: To enable immediate stroke detection at home.

Founded in 2019, Zeit Medical aims to radically transform the way strokes—a condition that affects nearly 1 million Americans annually—are detected and treated, all from the comfort of home. Their smart headband, powered by cutting-edge AI and wearable sensors, constantly monitors the electrical activity of the brain. When it identifies signs of a stroke, it promptly alerts emergency services (911), significantly reducing the delay that often contributes to long-term disabilities and exorbitant medical costs.

#### The Problem at Hand

Strokes are a time-sensitive medical emergency. Unfortunately, over 90% of stroke sufferers in the U.S. go untreated, which inevitably leads to debilitating effects and skyrocketing healthcare expenditures exceeding $100 billion. The underlying issue? A staggering number of individuals—over 10 million Americans at elevated risk—live with anxiety, fearing that if a stroke occurred during the night or while they were alone, it would go unnoticed. Founded by Orestis Vardoulis, PhD (a biomedical and mechanical engineer) and Urs Naber, MD (a critical care physician), both driven by personal experiences of stroke in their families, Zeit Medical was born out of an innovation fellowship at Stanford.

#### Innovative Solution

The Zeit Medical headband is more than just a piece of wearable technology; it embodies a proactive approach to brain health. It continuously scans for specific patterns in EEG readings that signal a neurological crisis, akin to how an EKG detects arrhythmias. This ability enables swift diagnosis and intervention when needed.

Their vision extends beyond immediate stroke detection; they aspire to provide comprehensive brain health monitoring across diverse environments. Currently, they support both hospital-based and at-home patient care, offering continual monitoring, efficient data annotation for healthcare providers, and a peace-of-mind for families at home.

#### Background and Development

- **Location**: Redwood City, CA
- **Founders**: Orestis Vardoulis (PhD), Urs Naber (MD)
- **Team Size**: Two dedicated employees
- **Funding**: Zeit Medical is part of Y Combinator Batch S21 and has garnered support from various backers.

With a small but passionate team, Zeit Medical stays true to its patient-centered philosophy, guided not just by medical professionals, but by the real experiences of stroke survivors.

#### Why It Matters

Why does this matter? Because Wenn the stroke alarm goes off and help is on the way, lives are saved, disabilities are avoided, and the fear that millions live with can be alleviated. As the technology advances and more people become aware of it, Zeit Medical is positioned to play a critical role in handling one of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S.
