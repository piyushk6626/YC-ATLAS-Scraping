Founded in 2024 and backed by Y Combinator's Batch F24, Alex is on a mission to streamline the iOS development experience with its innovative tool, the Alex Sidebar. Located in a yet-to-be-disclosed environment, the company operates with a lean team of just one employee—an indicator of the startup's nimble approach to solving developer pain points.

**The Problem**

Every iOS developer knows the struggle: constantly switching tabs in Xcode is tedious and interrupts the flow of coding. Alex was born out of the frustration of this workflow inefficiency. The team set out to create a solution that removes these friction points—hence the Alex Sidebar.

**The Solution: Alex Sidebar**

This app serves as a powerful AI copilot for Xcode, allowing developers to quickly access functionalities that usually require several clicks or tab switches. It features commands analogous to popular tools, like Cmd+L and Cmd+K for quick text selection and code application, making it snappy and user-friendly.

**Key Features:**

- **Instant Chat**: Select text in Xcode and start a conversation about it right away.
- **Image Chat**: Drag an image into the sidebar to generate corresponding code.
- **Semantic Codebase Search**: Grip your entire codebase semantically to find what you need.
- **Fast Code Apply**: Apply changes to your code rapidly.
- **Error Autofix**: One-click solutions to common coding errors.
- **Automatic File Creation**: Refactor and create files without manual intervention. 

**Pricing Structure:**

Alex offers a free plan—ideal for newcomers and those curious about the tool—allowing for limited chat and code applications. For more serious developers, a Pro plan is available for $20 per month, featuring unlimited capabilities.

**Community Engagement:**

Alex encourages interaction through its community Discord channel, making it clear that user feedback and engagement are prioritized in their development process.

**Why This Matters:**

As software development grows increasingly complex, the tools we use must evolve as well. Alex recognizes the need for faster, more integrated development environments, and seeks to equip developers with the tools necessary to maintain focus and productivity.

For those weary of tab-switching and looking for a smoother coding experience, Alex may just be the sidebar solution they’ve been searching for.

Autumn is a startup that launched in 2024 as part of Y Combinator's Batch F24, geared towards simplifying the way businesses handle pricing models. With just a team of two, Autumn has a clear mission: to let developers build any pricing model within a couple of lines of code. This concept stems from its foundation as an open-source layer over Stripe, designed to tackle the complexities of pricing and billing.

**What It Does:**
At its core, Autumn helps businesses create customizable billing solutions effortlessly. Users can define pricing models for subscriptions, usage, add-ons, and more, all without heavy engineering overhead. The key selling point? With Autumn, you can embed a complete pricing solution into your application swiftly. Just define how users are charged, connect products to Stripe, and Autumn handles the rest—tracking subscriptions and entitlement checks seamlessly.

**Why It Matters:**
In today's competitive landscape, companies need flexibility in their pricing strategies, but traditional methods can be cumbersome and prone to errors. Autumn addresses this by reducing development time and assembling a product that allows for quick iterations and easier updates to pricing models. It removes the headaches associated with managing customer subscriptions and integrations, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than infrastructure.

**Funding and Support:**
Autumn is backed by notable investors, including Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, providing it with the necessary resources to continue developing its platform.

**Team:**
The company is based in an undisclosed location, with a compact team of two, led by Group Partner Pete Koomen.

**Conclusion:**
If you're a developer or a startup looking to streamline your billing efforts, Autumn positions itself as a powerful ally.

- **Seamless Integration:** Chorrie doesn’t require clients to switch platforms. Their tools can be integrated into existing practice management systems without the costs and frustrations of training.
  
- **Pay-for-Performance Model:** They’ve adopted a no-risk pricing structure. You only pay for the claims they flag as incorrect—no flat fees, just results.

- **HIPAA Compliance:** Patient data security is paramount. Chorrie is HIPAA-compliant, ensuring that no patient data is used to train their models without individuals’ consent. They offer zero-retention options to keep data safe.

### Why It Matters:

In the healthcare landscape, where billing errors can lead to significant revenue loss and operational headaches, Chorrie provides an essential service. By automating claim checks, they allow billing teams to focus on what really matters—providing excellent patient care rather than getting bogged down in revenue cycle management challenges.

Chorrie is part of Y Combinator's Batch F24—an indication of their potential for growth. With just a two-person team and a strong backing, they’re poised to improve billing processes across the healthcare industry.

Founded in 2023 and nestled in the heart of San Francisco, Curo is emerging as a game-changer in the electric vehicle (EV) charging landscape. Their mission is straightforward yet ambitious: enable electric fleets to park and charge anywhere with ease.

Initially, Curo set out to address a glaring issue: EV charger owners see a mere 15% utilization of their expensive infrastructure. Meanwhile, fleets are in a frenzy to electrify, but charging availability remains a significant bottleneck. Curo's solution? A standardized platform that allows any EV charger host—think office buildings where employees park overnight—to lease their chargers to fleets. This innovative approach doesn’t just solve a widespread problem; it significantly increases the revenue potential for charger owners by an impressive factor of five.

Curo's platform, dubbed the ""Virtual Depot,"" operates as the first dedicated network aimed at connecting commercial fleets with accessible, cost-effective EV charging solutions. In a few short months, Curo has already expanded into five states and is experiencing rapid growth, boasting a 50% month-over-month increase. Their commitment to transforming the electric transportation sector has garnered backing from notable investors, including Blue Bear and Eniac.

With a lean team of six employees and a former Y Combinator accelerator experience, Curo is making its mark in the burgeoning startup ecosystem. They offer fleets the opportunity to tap into an exclusive network of charging sites—affordably and conveniently. The platform promises short, medium, and long-term solutions designed to meet fleet needs, ensuring minimal disruption.

As we shift towards a more electrified future, Curo stands at the forefront, not just facilitating charging but actively participating in the sustainability movement. Curo’s system promises not just operational convenience; it also leverages existing EV charging infrastructure, effectively reducing costs and inefficiencies across the board.

Their mission? To be the sentry for AI voice agents, ensuring these agents are as efficient and bug-free as possible. 

The founders, who previously developed voice agents at PlayHT, faced a common problem: diagnosing bugs was a painstaking process, involving countless hours of manual testing. To solve this, they built a platform that automates the testing of voice agents, allowing developers to quickly identify where things go wrong. This backstory not only shows their expertise but fuels their commitment to creating a more effective tool for other developers.

Fixa offers powerful features for developers to monitor their AI voice agents. Their platform tracks latency, interruption rates, and even correctness in responses. They provide custom alerts through Slack to keep users informed when something doesn’t go as planned. 

Recently, they launched an open-source voice agent testing package, allowing other developers to contribute to and benefit from their work. In terms of pricing, they have a straightforward pay-as-you-go model, which is perfect for teams just starting out, alongside more comprehensive enterprise options for larger organizations.

With a lean team of just two people (growing, no doubt), Fixa is already trusted by companies like 11x and OfOne. They’ve kicked off their journey under the Y Combinator Accelerator’s F24 batch, gaining invaluable support and exposure in the tech community.

Today's email products try to help you go through your emails a little faster, but if you have to get through 1000 emails, those products doesn't do much for you. 

The reality is, most of the emails you get don't require you to personally look at them. Friday completely eliminates the need to check those emails, and handles them all at once for you, immediately. 

Friday is here to file away spam, sift through newsletters for important tidbits, text you important notifications, and reply to mundane emails, so that no matter how many thousands of emails are in your inbox, you'll just be left with the few emails that actually require your personal touch.

**Company Overview:**
Gait, founded in 2024 and part of the Y Combinator Batch F24, is a San Francisco-based startup with a mission to streamline the development infrastructure for AI software engineers. Despite being a young company, Gait has quickly carved out a niche by addressing a common problem faced by developers working with AI-generated code.

**What Gait Does:**
Initially, Gait emerged as a response to confusion surrounding blocks of AI-generated code. Through their innovative Cursor and VS Code extension, Gait allows developers to view the prompts that generated the AI code, thus fostering a clearer understanding and more efficient collaboration among team members. Key features include:

- **AI Blame:** This feature links specific prompts and conversations directly with the corresponding pieces of generated code, making it easier to track the origins and rationale behind each line of code.

- **Team Collaboration:** Gait enables teams to share AI-assisted development context through version control, enhancing collective understanding and streamlining code reviews.

**How It Works:**
1. **Capture Conversations:** Gait automatically saves AI interactions into a designated file within the `.gait` folder.
2. **Commit to Repo:** Developers commit the `.gait` folder alongside their code to share context with their teammates.
3. **Understand Code:** While reviewing code or making further edits, developers can reference the prompts that led to specific code generation.

**Getting Started:**
Using Gait is straightforward:
- Install the Gait extension from the VS Code or Cursor marketplaces.
- Gait will read the chat history automatically, allowing developers to navigate through various files and review generated code based on prompts.

**Plans:**
Gait offers a tiered service model:
- **Open Source:** Free access, basic AI conversation capture, and analytics.
- **Pro Version:** Includes advanced features like code review tools, prompt replay, model comparison, and enhanced analytics, along with protections for copyright and IP.

**Team and Leadership:**
Gait operates with a lean team of two and is mentored by Pete Koomen, who plays a pivotal role as their group partner at Y Combinator.

### Conclusion
In a world where AI is increasingly replacing traditional coding methods, Gait stands out by demystifying the process. With a focus on enhancing collaboration and comprehension among developers, Gait represents a significant step toward making AI tools more accessible and useful in everyday programming tasks.

#### Mission

Gecko Security's mission is straightforward: to leverage AI to act as your code's personal security engineer. Their goal? To find and fix vulnerabilities quickly, without the fuss of ineffective security tools or the fleeting reliability of one-off human penetration tests.

---

#### How It Works

Gecko's technology dives deep into your applications, simulating real-world attacks to uncover critical vulnerabilities. Here’s what sets them apart:

- They go beyond traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools by identifying business logic flaws and complex vulnerabilities that others often overlook.
- Gecko utilizes AI not just to surface problems, but to validate vulnerabilities by simulating exploits. This means fewer false positives, ensuring your team isn’t swamped with noise.
- The tool takes a practical approach by providing actionable fixes, helping developers maintain a secure codebase without slowing down their workflow.

---

#### Key Features

- **Offense-driven Security:** Identify and repair issues usually detected in bug bounty programs or penetration tests.
- **Low False Positives:** AI-assisted verification of vulnerabilities ensures only real issues are flagged.
- **Threat Modeling:** Custom scenarios that mimic potential attacks help you understand how vulnerabilities could be exploited in your environment.
- **Continuous Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with your development processes, ensuring every pull request is secure before merging.

---

#### Offerings

Gecko Security features two primary subscription plans:

1. **Free Open Beta (Basic Plan):**
   - Testing on up to 3 repositories
   - Basic offensive security engine
   - AI-generated fixes for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript
   - For codebases less than 20,000 lines

2. **Enterprise Plan:**
   - Testing on unlimited repositories
   - Advanced security features and integrations with CI/CD pipelines
   - Customizable solutions for larger teams

---

#### Why Choose Gecko?

Gecko is particularly appealing for teams that wish to scale their development while keeping security tight. The platform minimizes the burden on engineers, ensuring patches are applied effortlessly, which ultimately helps in shipping secure code faster. 

In a world where software vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic failures, Gecko Security emerges as a proactive ally, making sure that security is integrated into the development process, rather than bolted on as an afterthought.

This flexibility helps businesses increase cart conversions by up to 20% while reducing delivery errors.

4. **Pricing Options**: Getcho presents three flexible pricing plans:
   - **Starter Plan**: Ideal for small businesses getting off the ground, starting at $0/month.
   - **Growth Plan**: A step up at $250/month for multi-location businesses needing more features.
   - **Enterprise Plan**: Custom solutions for larger enterprises that need advanced features and unlimited scalability.

#### Customer Focus

Getcho isn't just about delivering goods; it’s about creating an experience. Many local businesses sing praises of Getcho's hands-on approach and seamless service.

Founded in 2024 and proudly part of Y Combinator's Batch F24, HealthSpark is based in San Francisco. With a lean team of two, they’re on a mission to empower physical therapists to create and manage their own independent, AI-driven practices efficiently.

So, what does that look like? HealthSpark takes the pain out of practice management by handling the administrative drudgery—insurance credentialing, scheduling, call management, and charting—allowing therapists to focus on what they do best: helping patients recover and thrive. Their platform includes an AI-native Electronic Health Record (EHR) and a Call Inbox, making it easier for practitioners to keep their operations smooth and client-focused.

Dalton Caldwell, a seasoned partner, is a guiding force behind this innovative venture. It’s no wonder HealthSpark has resonated with those in the health tech space—they’re merging cutting-edge artificial intelligence with essential healthcare services to improve patient outcomes.

Imagine starting your own practice with minimal hassle. HealthSpark's offerings include a comprehensive dashboard for clients, secure messaging, billing management, and even marketing support to attract new clients. It’s a refreshing take on traditional practice management, putting control firmly in the therapists' hands, while providing all the tools they need to be successful.

Worried about existing clients? HealthSpark won’t constrain your current practice; it's designed to enhance and grow it. And the best part? There’s no cost to join.

Founded in 2024 and based in Palo Alto, Innate is on a mission to make robotics accessible and intuitive. As part of the Y Combinator Batch F24, the company is focused on developing general-purpose robots that anyone can teach and use effectively. The core idea is simple: lower the barrier to entry in robotics, making it available for builders of all backgrounds.

Innate is particularly excited about its first robot, Maurice. This compact device embodies the company’s visionary approach—it's not just a product; it's a platform for creativity. Maurice is designed for builders, capable of understanding and executing tasks based on user input in as little as 30 minutes. Imagine teaching your robot to pick up trash or monitor your home for intruders, all done easily and intuitively.

The team, currently just two strong, is led by Nicolas Dessaigne as their Group Partner. They are diving into the realms of generative AI and hard tech, weaving together the nuances of robotics, AI assistants, and consumer interactions. This multidisciplinary approach is evident in Maurice's design, which uses complex learning algorithms to adapt and respond in real-time to its environment, ensuring a blend of autonomy and user control.

### What's Next?

Innate's first units are slated for shipping in Winter 2025, a timeline that fuels the anticipation among potential users. They emphasize community engagement, inviting interested individuals to join their [Discord](https://innate.bot/<https:/discord.com/invite/KtkyT97kc7>) channel. 

Their website (https://innate.bot) showcases not only the technology and capabilities of Maurice but also serves as a hub for documentation and user inquiries. They are ready to welcome preorders and are engaging with users, offering a glimpse into the future of household robotics.

In essence, Innate isn’t just building robots; they’re crafting new opportunities for interaction and creativity in our daily lives. As they continue to develop this innovative technology, they stand poised to make a significant impact on the future of home automation and robotics.",Nicolas Dessaigne,https://www.ycombinator.com/people/nicolas-dessaigne,Teachable general-purpose robots,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/innate,Palo Alto,https://bookface-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/95a9ec0e4dc4b29877a32be752e57a99d52526a9.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQC4NIECAEHIR6H6F%2F20250221%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250221T191432Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjELP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDt736ZW5EfzagAz1eKRSs%2FW4TfHu28RBSFaRNkZ9h47gIhANt6WXtwkgL07bQKDKYDGFxYKx7WOO9JX0BqaYrXnKNbKu4DCNz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMMDA2MjAxODExMDcyIgx8TqkMwTM2PLcRmr4qwgPGGtQBXv7gs7%2BXGteI1gQk%2FjkbIHwQ5hCKXJKVmVAPw3MeVLhZyp8Nf5%2FYigbwE%2BrFR7aZWKjrs7HxAE0JWit5dlINZLjZK%2BS%2FwMaCqoj%2BFDN0gw9iiAPu4Xn5c3b%2BuZe%2F5%2Flfk0EuxZAXVsZtShxXZy%2FERPQ0v%2FRZxSz5qUoaXpL1zj6VWdWVzoI7%2FPlB3bgJ2PpiF7DN%2BJeDsJPx%2FoKTo5ehP9pOeGbMNxoeegVJsCJ3zvzO3o4fcZYIf6c5iIJwM1Ot3Gg7Z3v9oLZjSRU%2FaRLL5j4n3II7DaroOCEVfPlWzTyZM7SNFZZAFSKM8vLKj1VdTr9s3How41zluf%2FOIp7sGNhG%2FjuYJoG%2FmkLFIlYP4wbGrLO69AWnenZyfi1UhAiV6N%2BlAqGnqvpOJh4vq8uNh2eRnXR%2BMVXdq9oVYkm7XFgprL5PDC4ULLyBWqA6kca4z7F4H56nkT%2FsDtT8ek2VOIRIv1Zgcz%2BeeVG7F7AHS4bdbR6eZ3ChY1iQhfPBErh4OiFQM7IqiUKw%2B1CTpvL68xcVN5gjiaDH0Jotw%2BUcW9dMSg9py8xH8qgyiWG5w3dDj9xaoA2G3NMYq6JOGKMwwIrjvQY6pAHDH54nhADhmb7YSEGxHkL3pqs%2B6aYOExStWbzLKzRb3lb2DAgGG8uU9COt8%2FqUEOtOcszTKp7yuCJwMVkfI7PDZ74h9uiRkRxjtH7%2BLlE1xrfd%2FrIq%2B%2BZr9hSFqZ9MUQ4yNHesyx2FYDbsIfCW9ntlrpmZUHCcrzpQDfufsAFcpe%2FudVT3tUqiF8WCN1Vd%2Bx%2FQ9d3i1HvBcJWV9AYAwM0W22VM%2BA%3D%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=33ac6379555515c879a42629bb4c81a9926bf4f85ef017ed05c10dfeabf4d522,data/logos\Innate_logo.png,Innate,"['https://www.linkedin.com/company/innate-bot', 'https://x.com/innate_bot']",True,industry:generative-ai; industry:hard-tech; industry:robotics; industry:consumer; industry:ai-assistant; location:san-francisco-bay-area,2.0,https://innate.bot

The company's primary mission is to streamline administrative tasks that often bog down project managers. Karmen integrates seamlessly with existing emails, project management software, and ERP systems to automate processes like invoice handling and approvals. This kind of automation is crucial; for instance, one construction company faced up to $50,000 in daily costs due to project delays caused by invoicing errors. Supplier management issues contribute to 20% of these delays, highlighting the immense value of Karmen's solution.

The team currently consists of just two dedicated employees, and the company is under the guidance of David Lieb as its Group Partner. Karmen’s technology also ensures real-time updates on project changes and organizes incoming information such as purchase orders and invoices, greatly enhancing productivity. By automatically extracting key details from emails and matching them to projects, Karmen eliminates the repetitive manual data entry burden and allows project managers to focus on keeping their endeavors on schedule.

With a robust commitment to integration, Karmen supports a variety of popular construction management tools, providing a comprehensive view of all project data in one place. For project managers, it’s like having an additional team member—one who never sleeps and can manage backend tasks efficiently.

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch F24, Metreecs offers a cutting-edge solution for retail inventory management, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Their mission is straightforward yet impactful: to optimize demand forecasting for retailers, enabling them to buy, allocate, and plan their products more efficiently.

**How It Works:**
Metreecs employs AI-driven demand forecasting to tackle two critical retail challenges—overstock and out-of-stock situations. By providing actionable insights, the platform helps retailers streamline inventory decisions, reducing waste, freeing up capital, and ultimately enhancing sales performance. This means customers can restock before products sell out while minimizing excess inventory. As a result, they can expect an impressive increase in sell-through rates by up to 20%, capture more sales opportunities leading to a 35% growth in revenue, and achieve remarkable ROI, sometimes up to 10x.

**Current Operations:**
Despite being a small team with just three employees, Metreecs has positioned itself as a vital partner for retailers looking to revolutionize their inventory strategies. The company is based in Tigery, France, with Nicolas Dessaigne as the Group Partner steering their strategic vision. 

Their platform offers a robust suite of features designed to optimize product management, such as:
- **Rebalance**: Automated suggestions to allocate inventory effectively.
- **Reorder**: Predicting top-performing products to prevent stock outages.
- **Buy**: Facilitating purchasing decisions based on data-driven insights.
- **Analyze**: Tracking product performance across various sales channels.

**Why It Matters:**
With the retail landscape becoming increasingly competitive, Metreecs champions the idea that intelligent inventory decisions can differentiate successful retailers from those struggling to keep up. Their approach not only mitigates risks associated with stock management but also empowers retailers to respond dynamically to market changes.

Founded in 2024 and based in the vibrant tech ecosystem of San Francisco, Moonshine is carving out a niche in the realm of video technologies. As a proud member of Y Combinator’s Batch F24, this ambitious startup is on a mission: to provide scalable APIs for video understanding. With a lean team of just two, they're ambitiously tackling the complexities of video data, making it simpler for users to derive meaningful insights.

So, what does Moonshine offer? At its core, the company simplifies video infrastructure management, providing a platform where users can upload videos and engage with them like never before. You can think of it as bridging the gap between raw video content and actionable information, enabling businesses to focus on what truly matters—building their products.

Here’s a quick rundown of its standout features:

1. **Affordable Video Ingestion**: Users can ingest videos at a cost that is reportedly ten times cheaper than competitors.
2. **Real-time Efficiency**: Moonshine runs video understanding on-device and at lightning speed, ensuring immediate results.
3. **User-friendly Integration**: The API is designed to get developers up and running with just three lines of code.
4. **Flexible and Scalable**: It can handle hundreds of videos simultaneously on a fully serverless infrastructure, giving businesses robust operational capacity.
5. **Security and Privacy**: Data privacy is a priority, with options for secure data storage and on-prem indexing.

Moonshine has set out to address not just the mundane task of managing video content but also the more complex inquiries that come with it. For instance, users can ask specific questions like ""Find clips of a pink dress"" or ""What are the main reasons for poor airflow on this fan?"" This capability sets them apart, showcasing their focus on providing granular insights.

Given its early days, the company has already sparked interest with practical applications, from generating insurance claims based on video evidence to monitoring live camera feeds. 

In a nutshell, Moonshine is all about simplifying video data management so businesses can intuitively extract insights from their content without the overhead. Whether you're an entrepreneur or a tech enthusiast, the potential here is vast— and the journey has just begun.

#### Mission
At OpenClinic, the goal is straightforward yet revolutionary: empower healthcare through AI. They operate with a structure that's 99% AI and just 1% doctor, streamlining the healthcare delivery model so physicians can focus on high-value care while technology handles the routine tasks.

#### How It Works
OpenClinic provides a digital platform that allows any medical professional or institution to launch their own virtual clinic. The AI assistant conducts initial consultations by collecting detailed medical histories using a voice-based, empathetic interface. It evaluates symptoms and suggests likely diagnoses, while licensed doctors review AI-generated summaries to make informed decisions about patient care. 

This unique blend enables doctors to see more patients efficiently—just imagine cutting the tedious paperwork down to a page or two, while providing better care based on evidence-based treatment suggestions.

#### Benefits
1. **Empathy at Scale:** The AI doesn't just take notes; it engages patients in natural conversations, making history-taking feel more personal and less mechanical.
2. **Safety Checks:** Safety is paramount at OpenClinic. Their system includes several checkpoints to ensure that cases are suitable for virtual care before being routed to physicians. 
3. **Faster Payments:** Transactions are simplified: doctors receive payments immediately for their services, allowing them to focus entirely on patient care.
4. **Support from Doctors:** Three of the four co-founders are practicing medical doctors. This insider expertise means that OpenClinic isn't just tech for tech's sake; it's designed with real doctor needs in mind.

#### The Team
OpenClinic is led by a small but skilled team, with David Lieb serving as the Group Partner. Their collective experience numbers over 10,000 patient interactions, which directly informs the product's design.

#### Conclusion
OpenClinic is not just another health-tech startup; it’s a rethinking of how healthcare can be delivered in the digital age.

**Mission**: OpenFunnel is on a mission to provide personalized AI agents tailored for AI-first Go-To-Market (GTM) teams.

- **Real-Time Prospecting**: The agents capture intent signals from various channels—including social media platforms, blogs, and even job boards—delivering leads just when they are most receptive.
- **No Setup Time**: Quick integration via Slack ensures that teams can start getting warm prospects immediately.
- **Self-Improving**: The agents utilize user feedback for constant refinement, making them smarter with each interaction.

### Testimonials
OpenFunnel's effectiveness speaks through customer feedback:
- “You guys save me hours a week—it's like I have an up-to-the-minute pulse on exactly what AI dev communities are thinking about.”
- “I did not expect it to work this well within a few hours after onboarding.”

Founded in 2024 and currently a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch F24, Origami Agents is on a mission to reshape how businesses connect with their ideal customers. The founders, Finn Mallery and Kenson Chung, aren’t just any entrepreneurs; they come with rich backgrounds from the startup ecosystem, with Finn having built custom outbound solutions for over 20 startups and Kenson serving as the CTO at an enterprise sales startup. They realized they were developing a solution for clients repeatedly, a tool that outshone traditional outbound methods tenfold.

So, what exactly do Origami Agents do? They deploy a massive army of digital agents that act like dedicated sales reps. These agents comb through the vast expanse of the web—analyzing websites, press releases, and product pages—to identify the top 1% of potential customers for each business every single day. But it doesn’t stop there; they help make sense of the remaining 99% of unstructured data, providing insights that a human rep simply couldn’t manage alone.

**How it Works:** Origami Agents leverage sophisticated scraping technologies to understand customer behavior and industry trends. Imagine having an intelligence that not only finds leads but also provides context and relevance for outreach. For example, agents can sift through job postings to identify companies hiring for specific roles or track customer sentiment through reviews. They read through complex websites and glean actionable insights, narrowing down prospects who truly need your solution.

From leveraging LinkedIn updates to evaluating business reviews, Origami Agents continuously adapt and get smarter with every interaction. They give companies the ability to engage with their perfect customers at the right moment, ensuring that no lead goes unturned.

**Meet the Team:** 
- **Finn Mallery**, co-founder, studied AI at Stanford and has extensive experience in outbound strategies. 
- **Kenson Chung** brings a wealth of engineering and sales expertise from his past role in a major SaaS company.

With just two employees currently operating out of “nan” (a placeholder for location, perhaps hinting at the digital nature of their business), they aim to maximize outreach efficiently and effectively.

If you’re looking for a way to supercharge your sales efforts and cut through the noise in customer acquisition, Origami Agents might just be the perfect solution. Their approach is straightforward yet revolutionary, making it more attainable than ever for businesses of all sizes to find their ideal clients.

Founded in 2024 and located in the heart of San Francisco, Pearson Labs is on a mission to revolutionize corporate transactions through the power of AI. The startup emerged from Y Combinator's Batch F24, emphasizing that its technology isn't just fancy software—it's specifically designed to automate and streamline the transactional processes that large law firms typically manage.

The goal? To help big players like Orrick reduce operational costs by 40-60% while dealing with massive volumes of corporate transactions, which collectively amount to an astonishing $3-6 trillion annually. Lawyers, usually taking a sizable cut of about 1-3% (translating to around $150 billion per year), struggle to manage the scale and complexity of these transactions. Pearson Labs aims to change that by creating AI agents capable of handling M&A due diligence and financing tasks effectively.

Looking ahead, they envision capturing 50% of the corporate transaction market, primarily through partnerships with the top 30 law firms. Eventually, Pearson Labs plans to empower companies themselves to execute these transactions directly, maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs.

Currently a lean team of two, Pearson Labs is positioned to scale rapidly and capture a share of the growing legal tech market. Under the mentorship of Group Partner Nicolas Dessaigne, they are carving out their niche in an industry ripe for automation.

Founded in 2024 and based in San Francisco, Reticular is on a mission to revolutionize drug discovery through interpretable artificial intelligence. Initially conceived to assist pharmaceutical companies by making AI models like AlphaFold more navigable—akin to how we can prompt large language models—Reticular addresses a pressing issue in the biotech space: the overwhelming challenge posed by limited validation data. 

In the world of drug discovery, companies often waste millions on experiments that yield little to no meaningful data. It’s a punishing cycle of trial and error that Reticular’s technology seeks to break. By providing an interpretability framework, they empower early-stage biotech firms to steer powerful AI models with far greater precision, even when data is scarce.

The founders, Nithin and John, both seem to have an impressive pedigree from competing in Biology Olympiads to spending four years at MIT as roommates, during which they published papers in leading journals like NeurIPS and Nature. Their core belief is that biological models, which encode a treasure trove of information, remain underutilized. The goal at Reticular? Unlock that potential.

Reticular is scaling quickly, having already identified the first interpretable features in protein models—features that allow for precise control over biological functions. They’re currently working closely with a select group of early-stage biotech partners to further develop this technology.

The company's focus lies in:
1. Helping researchers _peep inside_ biological AI for a clear understanding of decision-making processes.
2. Enabling the _steering of models_ more reliably, even amid data limitations.
3. _Accelerating development_ to reduce the costs tied to real-world testing.
4. Ensuring that _safeguards_ are baked directly into model capabilities.

They firmly believe that the future of drug discovery hinges on how well we can interpret these complex biological AI systems.

Backed by Y Combinator as part of Batch F24, Reticular is comprised of an agile team of two employees, with David Lieb serving as their group partner. Whether it’s through collaborations with pharma teams building generative pipelines for therapeutics or startups focused on biological language models, they are keen on partnering with innovators eager to explore the vast potential of the intersection between AI and biotech.

Founded in 2024 and making waves as part of Y Combinator's Batch F24, Revyl is a San Francisco-based startup with a clear mission—**Proactive Observability**. They aim to transform the way developers handle bug detection and triage, ensuring that issues are caught and addressed before they ever reach production. Their platform is designed to address some of the most frustrating problems in the development lifecycle, namely unreliable end-to-end testing and the tedious process of root cause analysis.

**The Problem**
- **Brittle Testing Practices**: Many current end-to-end tests are flaky and inconsistent, leading to unreliable outcomes. They require excessive maintenance, which detracts from building new features.
- **Fragmented Triaging**: Developers often find themselves sifting through a chaotic mix of testing and telemetry data, making it hard to pinpoint the source of bugs.

**Revyl's Solution**
Revyl offers a comprehensive **quality and control system** that streamlines the debugging process. Here's how they tackle the pain points:

1. **Real User Interactions**: Their platform automatically generates tests that mimic actual user behavior, allowing for precise monitoring that catches issues before they impact users.
   
2. **Agentic Flows**: Tests are built to withstand UI changes, enabling seamless execution from local development to production.

3. **Integrated Telemetry**: By connecting testing data with existing telemetry infrastructure, Revyl simplifies the root cause analysis, helping developers identify issues quickly.

4. **Automated Triaging**: Revyl provides visibility across the entire stack, drastically reducing the guesswork involved in debugging.

**Cross-Platform Testing**
Revyl’s capabilities extend across all major platforms:
- **Web**: Ditch flaky tests from Selenium and Playwright. Revyl offers reliable testing for web applications.
- **iOS**: Simplifies the complexities found in XCTest and EarlGrey with robust testing integrated into existing workflows.
- **Android**: Simplifies testing for the diverse Android ecosystem, mitigating common pitfalls of existing frameworks like Espresso.

**Save Time, Focus on Building**
With Revyl handling test creation and maintenance, developers can shift their focus back to what truly matters—building great software. If a bug slips through, Revyl promises to identify it swiftly.

**Team and Leadership**
With a compact team of three and Dalton Caldwell serving as their Group Partner, Revyl exemplifies the spirit of agility—small but impactful.

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch F24, Roundabout Technologies is on a mission to transform urban traffic management with their AI-powered traffic lights. The founding team, seasoned in safety-critical embedded systems and AI from companies like Waymo, Zoox, Google, and Verily, is committed to creating a safer, more efficient driving and walking environment for cities.

#### What They Do

Roundabout Technologies develops intelligent traffic signal systems that adapt in real time to the dynamics of road users—vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. By integrating seamlessly with existing cameras and hardware, their system has the ability to:

- **Optimize Wait Times:** The AI can anticipate and respond to the movements of all road users, ensuring that traffic signals adjust to minimize delays.
- **Enhance Safety:** By detecting speeding vehicles in critical areas and giving pedestrians extra time to cross, they contribute significantly to reducing accidents and enhancing safety for vulnerable road users.
- **Support Public Transport:** Their technology prioritizes buses and emergency vehicles without requiring additional hardware, making urban transit faster and more reliable.
- **Reduce Resident Complaints:** Unlike legacy systems that often lead to frustration due to poor decision-making, Roundabout’s solution improves the overall traffic flow, addressing common resident grievances.

#### Why It Matters

Traffic management isn't merely about moving cars; it’s about creating pedestrian-friendly cities that prioritize safety and efficiency. Roundabout Technologies stands out because they leverage advanced AI to provide nuanced, real-time traffic responsiveness, thus rethinking how traffic lights function in modern urban landscapes.

With a small team of just two employees and under the guidance of their Group Partner Pete Koomen, Roundabout Technologies is poised to make significant strides in urban traffic systems.

### Next Steps

**Overview:**  
Summed AI is an innovative startup located in Seattle, WA, and its mission is clear: to serve as the AI Copilot for insurance agents. Founded in 2024 and backed by Y Combinator's Batch F24, it specializes in simplifying the complexities of Medicare policy details, delivering accurate information up to **90% faster**. This efficiency helps insurance agents enroll clients quickly while remaining compliant with regulations.

**The Challenge:**  
Navigating Medicare and health insurance benefits can be a daunting task for both agents and consumers. There's a sea of paperwork and details that can lead to compliance issues if not handled correctly.

**The Solution:**  
Summed AI leverages artificial intelligence to extract critical benefit details from insurance documents, making it easier for insurance brokerages, carriers, and health tech companies to understand and communicate these benefits effectively. This not only accelerates the enrollment process but also reduces the risk of compliance dings.

**Who It’s For:**  
Summed AI is designed for several key audiences in the insurance industry:

- **Carriers**: Increase enrollee conversion rates with AI-powered shopping and enrollment tools.
- **Insurance Brokerages**: Improve handling times and compliance through enhanced plan recommendations and benefit verifications.
- **Health & Insurtech Developers**: Access APIs and data that enable powerful integrations and insights.

**The Team:**  
Currently, Summed AI is a lean operation, running with a team of three, and led by experienced group partner Pete Koomen. This small yet focused team is equipped to tackle the big challenges facing insurance agents today.

**Why It Matters:**  
Summed AI isn't just about speed; it's about ensuring that everyone—from insurance agents to consumers—understands what health benefits they’re entitled to. In a world where health care can be convoluted and obscure, making this information easy to access and comprehend is invaluable.

For a closer look at their offerings and to see how it works, you can visit [Summed AI](https://summed.ai).

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator's Batch F24, Sunset is a fintech company with a mission to help families find and manage the financial assets of loved ones after they pass away. With a small team of just two employees, and under the guidance of group partner Dalton Caldwell, Sunset is making strides in the consumer finance space.

**What Sunset Does**

Sunset offers a unique software tool that simplifies the often-overwhelming process of asset discovery and management during a time of grief. The platform helps identify various financial accounts—including bank, retirement, and investment accounts, as well as properties and vehicles—without triggering any notifications to the relevant institutions. Once all assets are discovered, Sunset assists in closing these accounts and consolidating the funds into a managed estate account.

Here’s how it works:
1. **Financial Discovery**: Sunset automatically identifies assets tied to the deceased without alerting financial institutions.
2. **Account Management**: Users have full control over which accounts to close and when, simplifying the estate settlement process.
3. **Integration with Major Institutions**: Sunset partners with banks, insurance companies, and retirement funds to streamline the asset closure and transfer process.

**User Experience**

Sunset’s service is currently free for asset searches, charging a fee based on the interest generated in the estate account once accounts are selected for closure. This model lowers the barrier to entry for families facing the challenges of estate management.

Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with families praising the platform for its clarity, ease of use, and significant time-saving benefits. Users have shared that Sunset simplifies what can be a daunting experience, allowing them to focus on what truly matters during difficult times. 

**Key Features & Benefits**
- **Comprehensive Asset Tracking**: Sunset locates bank accounts, credit cards, life insurance, and property holdings.
- **Privacy Compliance**: The platform adheres to stringent security standards, ensuring user data is protected.
- **Control Over Process**: Families dictate which accounts to close and when, without any rush.
- **Dedicated Support**: A customer support team is on standby to assist users throughout the process.

**Looking Forward**

Sunset is not just filling a gap in the market; it's recalibrating what families can expect from financial services during life’s toughest moments. By merging fintech solutions with a compassionate approach to consumer finance, Sunset stands out in the burgeoning area of death care services.

With a team of just two, their ambition is anything but small—they're on a mission to create an AI Co-Pilot that empowers users to craft top-notch designs and assets with ease.

The seed for Supercontrast was planted during their time at Hive, where they launched an AI art generator called Gencraft. Remarkably, they scaled Gencraft from zero to a million dollars in annual recurring revenue in just six months. This impressive feat fired up their motivation to develop Supercontrast further.

Currently incubated in the Y Combinator Batch F24, Supercontrast is positioned at the intersection of machine learning and design, tapping into what promises to be a booming market. The platform is poised for a rollout, as indicated by their “Coming Soon” notice on their website, which also invites interested users to join their waitlist.

With a lean team of just two, they're tackling a complex problem: the challenges of detecting and resolving errors in AI agents during production.

The idea behind Synth is deceptively simple but innovative. Users can easily integrate Synth into their systems by adding a few decorators to their AI agent code. This allows agents to run on custom datasets of questions collected from various sources. In return, Synth delivers a clean dataset of ""message triplets"" that can be used for fine-tuning models from providers like OpenAI, OpenPipe, Anthropic, and Gemini. This enhances the effectiveness of AI agents in real-world applications.

At its core, Synth is all about automation and optimization. Managing agent errors can be tedious and time-consuming, but Synth streamlines this through real-time monitoring and alerts. Their Python SDK simplifies integration, making it possible to start monitoring agents almost immediately. The platform learns from repeated failures, continuously improving the agents' performance—essentially taking a load off developers’ shoulders.

With a promising direction and strong backing, Synth is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the AI landscape by helping developers optimize their agents without the usual hassle.

**Technology & Impact:**
The technology behind Telli focuses on AI-driven voice agents capable of automating the entire pre-qualification stage for leads. A notable example includes their partnership with a leading home-buying platform, which leverages Telli's solution to automate its pre-qualification process fully. This kind of innovation not only enhances efficiency but also transforms the way companies interact with potential customers.

**Market Position:**
Telli positions itself in the intersection of artificial intelligence and software-as-a-service (SaaS), uniquely tailored for B2B applications within the B2C landscape. As the market evolves, their approach to automating outbound calls places them at a significant advantage, aligning with the needs of modern businesses that seek to maximize efficiency without sacrificing the personal touch that calls can offer.

**Leadership:**

Tiny, founded in 2024 and hailing from Singapore, is on a mission to transform the way factories operate. In a world where a staggering four million factories still rely on Excel, Tiny aims to build a new kind of ERP system that leverages AI agents to automate repetitive workflows. This isn’t just another software solution—it’s a rethink of how factories can utilize their data.

Focusing on the significant opportunities presented by large language models (LLMs), Tiny taps into the hidden, siloed unstructured data that many manufacturers possess. By doing this, they are not just streamlining operations but also unlocking the capabilities of just-in-time manufacturing across entire supply chains—an essential evolution in the current landscape of enterprise software.

### What Tiny Offers

With only three team members, Tiny is powered by the strategic guidance of Dalton Caldwell, their Group Partner at Y Combinator Batch F24. They are firmly positioned in the SaaS and B2B space, specializing in workflow automation tailored for manufacturing. Their platform promises to:

- **Reduce Costs**: Optimize financial outlays through better resource management.
- **Automate Tedious Tasks**: Allow staff to focus on strategic initiatives rather than repetitive workflows.
- **Uncover Valuable Insights**: Streamline sales, procurement, and production processes all in one place to enhance decision-making.

In essence, Tiny serves as a modern agentic ERP, designed to offer manufacturers significant operational improvements.

### Why Tiny Matters

The potential here is immense. By addressing the needs of a sector that's lagged in technological adoption, Tiny doesn’t just create a product; it fosters a community of connected manufacturers, potentially generating network effects that can reshape supply chains. Their tool is for factories ready to leap into a new era, powered by automation and intelligent data utilization.

Founded in 2024 and nestled in Charlotte, NC, Upshift is a dynamic player in the world of developer tools, specifically in the realm of software extensibility. Their mission? To enable businesses to transform their software products into thriving platforms. Think of a core product with the ability for users to create plugins, extensions, and add-ons that enhance its functionality.

At the helm are Adam and Thomas, engineering leaders with over six years of collaboration and a proven track record in system integration, having honed their skills at organizations like Palantir and Candid Health. Their experience includes significant projects like modernizing the US Army’s data infrastructure—a clear testament to their capabilities.

### Core Offerings

Upshift focuses on:

- **Easy, Safe Plugin Management:** They take the complexity out of managing plugins by offering type-safe orchestration that integrates seamlessly with various architectures.
- **Ecosystem Growth:** By enabling community-centric features where users can collaborate and share plugins, the value of the product grows exponentially.
- **Support and Maintenance:** Upshift tackles common concerns head-on—like third-party code safety, upgrade issues, and monetization—which historically have made extensibility daunting for many developers.

Founded in 2024, Vespper is making waves in the realm of software engineering by reimagining how teams manage production alerts. Operating out of Y Combinator's Batch F24, this tiny but ambitious startup comprises just two former senior engineers from Google, Snyk, and Viz.ai—Topaz and Dudu. They’ve experienced the stress of on-call duties firsthand and decided to create a solution that turns the chaos of tech support into a more manageable process.

### Mission and Product

At its core, Vespper is an AI agent that operates around the clock to troubleshoot production alerts, providing timely insights that reduce downtime and mitigate alert fatigue. This means less frustration for engineers who can focus on high-priority issues while Vespper automates the tedious aspects of incident response. Essentially, Vespper ensures that no alert falls through the cracks, significantly reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and preventing engineer burnout.

### Features and Integrations

Vespper boasts impressive capabilities such as:
- Real-time troubleshooting of alerts
- Anomaly detection in metrics
- Log querying for insights
- Assessment of customer impact
- Tracking and resolution history of incidents

It also integrates smoothly with popular tools like DataDog, Grafana, GitHub, and Slack, making life easier for teams by streamlining their workflows.

### The Problem They Solve

Being on-call is often a stressful duty fraught with data overload and unexpected outages. Vespper addresses these pain points by automating many of the tasks that lead to burnout and downtime. Their service is particularly valuable for companies that rely on stringent SLAs and need quick, reliable incident management. 

### Why Vespper Stands Out

What sets Vespper apart is how it’s built—by developers for developers. The founding team knows the struggles of managing alerts under pressure and has indeed created a product that helps teams become more agile and responsive. Additionally, Vespper offers robust security measures, user control over data, and the potential for self-hosting.

### Connect and Learn More

If you're intrigued and want to see Vespper in action, you can book a demo on their [website](https://vespper.com). Moreover, they maintain a vibrant Slack community where you can engage with fellow users and the team.
