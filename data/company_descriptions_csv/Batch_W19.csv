Founded in 2018 and hailing from the Y Combinator Batch W19, AI Insurance embodies innovation in the insurance sector. Based in San Francisco, this ten-person team has set out to transform how small to midsize insurance companies operate. They provide a comprehensive platform designed to streamline every facet of an insurance business—essentially doing for insurance what Salesforce did for sales.

**The Problem and the Opportunity**

Before AI Insurance arrived on the scene, many insurance companies relied heavily on outdated systems—think spreadsheets and filing cabinets. This inefficiency bled an astonishing 60% of revenue into administrative costs. With over 10,000 insurance companies wasting approximately $238 billion annually, there's a fertile landscape for change. 

**What They Do**

The AI Insurance platform is tailored for various insurance programs, including Risk Retention Groups (RRGs) and Third-Party Administrators (TPAs). It consolidates all insurance management needs into one user-friendly interface. Features include:

- **Claims Management:** Automated processing that saves time and reduces errors.
- **Financial Management:** Comprehensive financial tracking for better management of resources.
- **Digital Portals & Application Processes:** Simplifying client interactions.
- **Premium Billing and Policy Issuance:** Facilitating smoother financial transactions.
- **Data Management:** Centralized storage for all essential documents.

Moreover, the platform leverages AI to enhance automation across processes, helping operators focus more on growth and less on admin tasks. For instance, invoice auditing can be done by simply forwarding emails, while application parsing requires no more than a drag-and-drop.

As a nod to its effectiveness, AI Insurance claims that after a year of usage, it can predict claims costs with 25% greater accuracy than traditional adjusters. 

**Customer Praise**

The feedback from the industry is overwhelmingly positive. Clients describe the platform as “intuitive,” “beautiful,” and one of the best systems they’ve encountered throughout their insurance careers. Several have transitioned to in-house claims management, crediting AI Insurance for the ease and efficiency it provides.

**Why It Matters**

In a world where efficiency and accuracy are paramount, AI Insurance is equipped to meet the evolving needs of modern insurance companies. By enabling automation and data-driven decision-making, they're not just saving costs; they're paving the way for a smarter, more agile insurance industry.

Five of these reactors are 45-65 years old and are quickly coming to the end of their operational life. This has cultivated a fragile and lengthy supply chain, at odds with the nature of radioactive material.

This issue and its implications do not just effect molybdenum, but any other reactor-based isotope. Many promising cancer therapies are stuck in clinical trials, unable to secure enough material in a timely manner. Research doesn’t even happen because of the difficulty of sourcing any new isotopes.

Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator Batch W19, this innovative company is based in Idaho Falls, ID, and is tackling a significant issue in the world of radioisotope supply.

Currently, the backbone of nuclear medicine, Molybdenum-99—essential for 80% of procedures—comes from a few aging, government-run reactors abroad. Many of these reactors are nearing the end of their operational life, creating a precarious and inefficient supply chain. This isn’t just a problem for Molybdenum; it extends to other reactor-based isotopes, stalling promising cancer treatments and hindering research efforts.

Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator Batch W19, Boundary Layer Technologies is on a mission to reinvent marine transportation with a strong commitment to zero-emission solutions. Located in Alameda, CA, and operating with a small, dedicated team of just five, the company is set to change the way we think about watercraft.

At the heart of their innovation is the **Valo**, an ultra-performance electric foiling watercraft that flies two feet above the water at an impressive 58 mph. But it's not just about speed; the Valo operates in near silence, producing no waves and crucially, no emissions. This makes it not only exhilarating to ride but also environmentally friendly—ideal in today's climate-conscious world.

The technology behind the Valo is not just some fancy gimmick. It integrates advanced electric propulsion with hydrofoil wings, struts, control surfaces, and self-stabilization software. Together, these elements enable vessels to achieve **90% less energy consumption** and a **fourfold increase in range** compared to traditional electric boats. This means more adventure on the water without the guilt of pollution or the jarring experience of rough waves.

Boundary Layer Technologies is not just about crafting exceptional vehicles—it's about revolutionizing the entire industry. Their hydrofoil systems are designed to be adaptable, with the potential to enhance a range of commercial and recreational boats from 14 to 45 feet, making it accessible to various manufacturers without significant modifications.

As they prepare to launch the Valo Hyperfoil in 2025, the company is backed by over 40 years of hydrofoil experience within its team. This expertise is what ensures that their systems not only perform remarkably but are also reliable, promising an unmatched experience for users.

With a reality of dwindling natural resources and increasing environmental concerns, Boundary Layer Technologies stands at the forefront of a significant shift in transportation. As Ed Kearney, the CEO, aptly puts it, “The last time there was such a step change in transport technology was the turbofan jet engine.” Hydrofoils are poised to be the next monumental leap.

Bunkerhill Health has built a consortium of research institutions (Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, etc.), who develop and validate AI algorithms seamlessly under our legal umbrella (less than one week of setup time for a new project when using the Bunkerhill consortium, versus a year or more for projects outside the consortium). Bunkerhill then manages the FDA clearance and commercial sales process for the algorithms that these institutions develop and validate with us.

We’ve signed commercial contracts and deployed algorithms with the world’s leading health systems—UCSF, Mayo Clinic, Georgetown/MedStar, and several others. These algorithms help doctors identify patients earlier than has otherwise been possible, leading to better treatment outcomes (early clinical screening for heart disease, pancreatic cancer, etc.)

Choose your SDK and start coding! Dagger executes your pipelines entirely as standard OCI containers. This has several benefits: - Instant local testing - Portability: the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service. - Superior caching: every operation is cached by default, and caching works the same everywhere - Compatibility with the Docker ecosystem: if it runs in a container, you can add it to your pipeline. - Cross-language instrumentation: teams can use each other's tools without learning each other's language.",2018.0,[],"### Dagger: Revolutionizing CI/CD Pipelines

**Overview:**  
Founded in 2018 and a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch W19, Dagger is a forward-thinking company located in San Francisco. With a compact yet effective team of 22 dedicated employees, Dagger is on a mission to transform the way we think about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). They aim to empower developers to write their CI/CD pipelines as code, making it easy to run those pipelines anywhere.

**Product Concept:**  
Dagger started as a programmable CI/CD engine, leveraging the power of containers. The revolutionary idea is that you can develop your pipelines using the same programming languages you use for your applications: Go, TypeScript, or Python. This brings a myriad of benefits:

- **Instant Local Testing:** Run your pipelines locally just as you would in production.
- **Portability:** Your pipelines can run anywhere—from your laptop to cloud CI environments.
- **Superior Caching:** Operations are cached automatically, boosting performance, and ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Docker Compatibility:** If it runs in a container, it seamlessly integrates into your pipeline.
- **Cross-Language Instrumentation:** Teams can utilize each other's tools without needing to dive into unfamiliar languages.

**Core Features:**  
- **API-First Approach:** Dagger champions code over YAML, making complex CI scripts a thing of the past. The focus is on replacing cumbersome scripts with a more intuitive, programmable interface.
- **Standardized Modules:** Users can chain reusable Dagger functions to create efficient pipelines, built by themselves or the community.
- **High Performance:** Advanced caching techniques minimize unnecessary rebuilds and testing, accelerating delivery cycles.
- **Observability:** Gain deep visibility into your pipelines with interactive debugging tools to quickly identify and fix issues.

**Community and Resources:**  
Dagger encourages community involvement where developers can join discussions on platforms like Discord and GitHub. They offer extensive documentation, case studies, and example projects to help newcomers get started seamlessly.

**Conclusion:**  
Dagger is not just another tool in the CI/CD ecosystem; it stands out by simplifying complexity, enhancing developer experiences, and making pipelines as flexible and powerful as they should be. If your team is looking to eliminate the frustrations of ""push & pray"" deployments, Dagger is worth a closer look.

Dockup is a proactive solution tailored for engineering teams that need to navigate the complexities of manual and automated testing with confidence. By providing on-demand ephemeral environments, Dockup allows developers to test their code in real-time without the hassle of mock services. It’s akin to what CircleCI offers but with the added benefit of visualizing every code change within the entire tech stack, ensuring that pulls to the main branch are as seamless and reliable as possible.

### Evolution and Mission

Founded in Y Combinator's W19 batch, Dockup started with a clear mission: ""On-demand ephemeral environments to run manual and automated tests."" Nestled in Mountain View, California, and manned by a dedicated team of just four employees, Dockup has its sights set on simplifying the deployment process. They target developers who are fed up with sifting through convoluted DevOps tutorials and just want a practical solution.

### How Dockup Works

**Setup Process:**
1. Sign up and connect your GitHub and AWS accounts.
2. Dockup autonomously creates the necessary AWS resources for your deployments:
   - **CodeBuild** pulls your source code and builds Docker images.
   - **ECR** stores those images.
   - **EKS** runs them as containers.
   - **IAM** manages user and resource permissions.
   - Network configurations are automatically taken care of with VPCs, subnets, and security groups.

Once set up, deploying code is as easy as pushing to GitHub. You can manage deployment checklists, conduct manual deployments, or perform rollbacks through a user-friendly interface.

### Key Features

- **Free Forever**: Dockup doesn’t lock you in; it utilizes your infrastructure for deployments but can be easily unlinked whenever you need.
- **Auto Scaling and Load Balancing**: The platform dynamically adjusts to traffic patterns, adding or removing nodes as necessary.
- **Rolling Deployments**: Deploy new versions of services incrementally, ensuring zero downtime during updates.
- **SSL Management**: Automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates, taking one more task off your plate.

### Pricing

**Mission**: At its core, Eclipse Foods is on a mission to revolutionize the $500 billion dairy industry by leveraging plant-based technology to create dairy alternatives that mimic the taste, texture, and functionality of traditional dairy. Their secret sauce? Micelles—the microscopic wonders of milk.

**Core Products**: Eclipse has developed the first-ever plant-based dairy platform, allowing them to churn out a range of products, including their wildly popular plant-based ice creams, which are made from ingredients like corn, cassava, rapeseed, and potato. It’s dairy’s creaminess, without the dairy.

**Sustainability and Ethics**: Eclipse is not just about good taste. They aim to foster a food system that is more sustainable, healthier, and humane. This means creating delicious plant-based foods that require no compromise—that's a win-win for both consumers and our planet.

**Customer Focus**: Eclipse products are evidence that plant-based doesn’t mean tasting like cardboard. Rave reviews flood in from users who can’t believe they’re enjoying vegan treats that taste like the real deal—like their Cookie Butter Crumble and Peanut Butter Brownie ice creams.  

**Community Engagement**: Their presence extends beyond consumer products. Eclipse is committed to raising awareness about plant-based eating and its impact on climate change. Expect to see them in retail stores and foodservice venues, including partnerships with restaurants like Smashburger that are now offering dairy-free milkshakes.

### Why Now?

As consumers become more conscious of their food choices and how they impact their health and the environment, companies like Eclipse Foods are positioned at the frontier of this evolving market. Their ability to deliver indulgent, sustainable alternatives without sacrificing flavor sets them apart in a crowded space.

Founded in 2019, Edyst emerged as a Y Combinator-backed startup from the Winter 2019 batch. Based in Hyderabad, India, it carved out a niche in the online learning landscape, aiming to transform the educational and employability frameworks prevalent in the country.

**Mission and Vision**  
At its core, Edyst was all about peer-to-peer learning, providing a platform where students could enhance their skills in a collaborative environment. The mission was clear: to shake up the conventional approaches to learning and job readiness, particularly in a rapidly evolving market.

**Impressive Metrics**  
In just two years, Edyst achieved some remarkable statistics that many established players in the industry would envy: 
- A staggering **80% course completion rate**, which is eight times the industry average.
- On average, students engaged with the platform for **95 minutes daily**, five times more than typical usage metrics.
- A **50% placement ratio**, an impressive feat that is double the norm for online learning platforms.

These numbers highlight not only the effectiveness of their content but also the commitment of their learners—an ecosystem fostered by dedicated mentorship and a vibrant community.

**Team and Partnerships**  
Despite its relatively small size, with a team of just 11 employees, Edyst thrived on a culture of innovation and problem-solving. They sought out mavericks—individuals passionate about challenging the status quo and eager to make a lasting impact.

**End of an Era**  
Unfortunately, Edyst has announced its discontinuation. Over its operational period, it helped over **180,000 students** enhance their skills, with **40,000** securing jobs thanks to the training and opportunities it provided. The platform was more than just a learning tool; it became a crucial stepping stone for many in their career journeys.

---

Inito is revolutionizing the way women monitor their reproductive health by enabling at-home hormone tracking. Their mission centers on improving self-care through innovative technology that simplifies fertility management. With a dedicated team of around 100 employees and the backing of Y Combinator’s W19 batch, Inito is carving out a niche in the burgeoning fertility-tech and health-tech sectors.

#### What Makes Inito Unique?

At its core, Inito operates as an all-in-one fertility monitor, measuring four crucial hormones—Estrogen, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Progesterone (as PdG), and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)—all on a single test strip. Unlike conventional ovulation tests that typically provide binary “yes/no” results based merely on LH spikes, Inito gives detailed insights into hormone levels, helping women pinpoint their most fertile windows.

In just **10 minutes**, users can dip a test strip in urine, attach it to their smartphone (currently compatible with iPhone 7 and later), and receive personalized, actionable data. This data not only aids in predicting ovulation but also in confirming it, giving users a clearer picture of their fertility cycles. 

#### Why Choose Inito?

- **Comprehensive Hormone Tracking:** Inito is the only fertility monitor that tracks all four hormones simultaneously, providing a more nuanced understanding of menstrual cycles.
- **User-Friendly App:** The accompanying app simplifies the tracking process, sending notifications about test days, results, and confirmed ovulation.
- **Trusted by Couples:** With over 20,000 couples relying on Inito, testimonials highlight successful pregnancies facilitated by accurate hormone monitoring.

#### Key Features:

- **Real-Time Data**: Offers numerical values for hormone levels instead of generic readings, essential for those with irregular cycles.
- **Effective Confirmation**: Helps confirm ovulation through sustained PdG levels, which are critical for successful conception.
- **HSA/FSA Eligible**: This makes it easier for users in the U.S. to afford fertility testing.

#### Frequently Asked Questions:

- **What results does Inito provide?**
  Inito delivers results such as High Fertility, Peak Fertility, and Ovulation Confirmed, along with charts of hormone levels.
  
- **How many test strips are needed per cycle?**
  This varies; an average cycle might require 12-15 tests. 

- **Can I use HSA benefits?**
  Yes, Inito is eligible for HSA purchases.

- **Is it FDA approved?**
  It’s registered as a Class I medical device in the U.S., exempt from many premarket requirements, though it has not been explicitly cleared or approved.

Inito is more than just a product; it’s a tool that empowers women to understand their bodies better and enhance their chances of conception. Whether you’re actively trying to conceive or simply wanting to keep track of your hormonal health, Inito provides an insightful, data-driven approach to fertility monitoring.

**Company Overview:**
Founded in 2017 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch W19, Intelline is a Canadian startup located in Waterloo, Ontario, that’s developing a new kind of industrial power generator. With a compact team of three, they’re tackling a significant market opportunity in the industrial generator sector, valued at around $17 billion with 200,000 new units produced annually, each averaging $85,000.

**Mission:**
Intelline’s mission is straightforward yet impactful: ""We make generators that use 40% less fuel, with any fuel."" The goal is to transform how industries power themselves by creating more efficient systems.

**Technology:**
At the heart of Intelline's innovation is their Modular Linear Generator (MLG). This advanced system is capable of adapting to a variety of fuel types, including alternatives that traditional diesel engines can’t handle—flare gas, syngas, ammonia, and hydrogen. This means that businesses can switch between different fuel sources seamlessly, mitigating long-term fuel supply risks and reducing carbon emissions.

**Innovation Highlights:**
- **Fuel Efficiency:** The MLG can lower fuel consumption by up to 40% compared to modern diesel generators. This translates to significant savings; replacing a 1MW diesel generator with an Intelline MLG could save a company up to $1 million annually in fuel costs.
- **Multi-Fuel Compatibility:** Thanks to its CAVIE™ modules, the generator can switch fuel types on the fly, making it more adaptable and future-ready than traditional generators.
- **Scalable Power Output:** With a modular design, the system can be stacked up to 2MW in power, allowing users to tailor their energy needs without overcommitting to a fixed power solution.

**Market Position and Vision:**
Intelline is not just another player in the energy market; they're positioned as a sustainable alternative to traditional diesel options, aligning with the push for greener technologies. Their promise of reliability—being able to run on both fossil fuels and emerging clean energy sources—offers businesses the flexibility to transition without a complete overhaul of their systems.

**Why Choose Intelline?**
In a landscape where many companies are depending on battery or fuel cell technology—often limited by infrastructure—Intelline's generators stand out as low-risk, versatile solutions. They empower companies to implement sustainable practices without the fear of inconsistent supply chains that could disrupt operations.

**Get Involved:**
Intelline is on the lookout for innovative minds to join their small yet impactful team. Interested applicants can visit their careers page to see available positions.

Our virus-free gene editing platform allows us to engineer a dose of CAR-T cell therapy for ~$500, and brings the promise of a curative outcome. Given our safety and efficacy data to date, we believe this product could be used by general practice veterinarians, meaning we have thousands of customers all across the USA who typically treat with palliative care or refer cancer patients to specialty oncologists.

Founded in 2018 in Rochester, MN, and a proud member of Y Combinator's W19 batch, the company is laser-focused on developing living therapies primarily through CAR-T cell therapy. Their mission? ""Living therapies for pets first, and their people next."" This highlights a commitment not just to the well-being of animals but also acknowledges the impact these innovations will have on the owners who care for them.

Cancer is no small adversary, affecting approximately 6 million dogs in the U.S. each year. LEAH Labs is tackling this head-on with a groundbreaking approach that mirrors successful treatments in humans. Their CAR-T cell therapy, proven curative in human cases of B-cell lymphoma (akin to the dog equivalent), has shown promising early results in putting pets into remission. Remarkably, they've managed to reduce the cost of this revolutionary treatment to about $500 per dose, thanks to a virus-free gene editing platform.

What sets LEAH Labs apart is not only their innovative treatment but also their operational savvy. Their CAR-T therapy is regulated by the USDA rather than the FDA, which allows them greater leeway to iterate quickly and effectively on their products. This means that general practice veterinarians across the country, many of whom typically offer palliative care or refer cases to specialists, could potentially adopt their therapies.

With a lean team of three and strong backing from notable investors like Y Combinator, AgStartup Engine, and FIN Capital, LEAH Labs is primed for growth and impact. They’ve also secured grants from organizations like the NSF and NIH, demonstrating a solid foundation and trust from the broader scientific community.

In fact, about 50% of containers face such issues due to inefficiencies.

The platform employs advanced models and algorithms, effectively eliminating human errors and reducing delays by up to 40%. It’s not just about moving containers; Nowports provides a comprehensive solution that includes expedited transport options—air, sea, and land—as well as cargo insurance and real-time tracking, ensuring that shipments are always protected and visible.

Located in Mexico and boasting a team of over 550 employees, Nowports leverages technology to enhance operational visibility, offering services that not only centralize logistics operations but also assist businesses in their supply chain management.

Founded in 2018 and hailing from Y Combinator's Batch W19, Okteto has a straightforward mission: to streamline the development process for teams of all sizes by providing self-service cloud development environments with just one click. Based in San Francisco, the company has grown to a team of 30 dedicated employees, all focused on revolutionizing the developer experience.

The problem they tackle is familiar to anyone in tech: setting up local development environments can be a time-consuming headache. Okteto eliminates this hassle, allowing developers to dedicate their energy to building and delivering value instead of drowning in configuration issues or debugging production problems. Imagine being able to skip the long setup periods and jump straight into coding!

Okteto offers a suite of tools designed to automate environment provisioning, reduce build times, and expedite testing. With its innovative platform, developers can expect to reclaim a significant chunk of their time—up to 250+ hours annually—simply by reducing setup friction.

Some features that stand out include:

- **Self-Service Ephemeral Environments**: Developers can create and manage their own project-specific environments on demand.
- **Rapid Iteration with Hot Reloading**: Code changes can be seen instantly in production-like environments, cutting build wait times dramatically—by up to 97%.
- **Streamlined Onboarding**: New developers can get productive much faster, with a ramp-up time reduced from 90 days to just 45.

Companies that utilize Okteto report compelling results. For instance, Monday.com has seen a 50% increase in productivity, while Playable Worlds noted a $1 million savings in engineering costs by shifting left the verification process. The overarching theme is clear: when development processes are optimized, you not only save time but also enhance productivity across the board.

With a strong presence in the developer tools, SaaS, B2B, and Kubernetes spaces, Okteto aims to partner closely with its customers to reshape the way development teams operate. They are positioned as a go-to resource for modern development practices that embrace cloud-native technologies.

If you're looking to transform your development cycle and enable your team to innovate faster, Okteto is certainly worth a look.

Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's Winter 2019 batch, Prometheus is on a mission to reshape the energy landscape with innovative, sustainable solutions. Based in Santa Cruz, California, the company has a dedicated team of 25 employees focused on creating zero net carbon electrofuels using renewable energy sources like solar and wind.

At its core, Prometheus captures CO2 and water from the atmosphere and converts them into electrofuels—gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels—without modifying existing engines. This process does not introduce new CO2 into the atmosphere, effectively leaving fossil resources untouched. The company underscores the environmental benefits of its approach: every gallon of their electrofuels means a gallon of fossil oil that remains in the ground indefinitely.

What’s particularly compelling is that Prometheus has achieved a major breakthrough—their zero net carbon jet fuel competes on price with traditional fossil fuels, even coming in at one cent less per gallon. This has already caught the attention of major players in the airline industry; American Airlines has placed an order for 10 million gallons to be delivered next year.

In a world grappling with climate change, Prometheus is not just a fantasy but an actionable reality. They tag themselves in the realms of 'energy-storage' and 'climate,' emphasizing their dual focus on renewable energy and reducing global carbon emissions. The company's website, http://www.prometheusfuels.com, serves as a portal for more information about their groundbreaking work and future initiatives. 

With Jared Friedman as their Group Partner at Y Combinator guiding them, Prometheus is poised to play a significant role in the transition towards sustainable fuels.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W19,,,"PRONTO is the first RIDE-SHARING + DELIVERY platform for SECOND-TIER cities in LATAM. 

In second-tier cities all transactions are paid with cash, this is why the Uber model doesn´t work (since they have to collect their revenue from commissions). We solved this by creating a subscription model where drivers pay a monthly recurring subscription of 59 to 99 USD depending on their monthly revenue. This also generates a higher LTV with low CAC as well as high engagement and fidelity ratios.

Traction: Since our launch, we have achieved over 2,000,000 processed trips with more than 200,000 users, we bootstrapped until we achieved half a million trips and entered YC.

Market Size: There are over 14,000 second-tier cities in LATAM, with more than 500 million people without any access to ride-sharing or technology platforms at all.",,[],"### Company Overview: Pronto

**Mission:** Pronto is revolutionizing ride-sharing and delivery services in second-tier cities across Latin America. Recognizing that cash transactions dominate in these markets, the company has tailored its service to meet local needs in a way that traditional models, like Uber's, can't.

**Business Model:** Unlike typical ride-sharing platforms that charge drivers a percentage of their fares, Pronto operates on a subscription model. Drivers pay a monthly fee ranging from $59 to $99, depending on their revenue. This approach not only alleviates the problem of cash payments but also enhances customer lifetime value (LTV) while keeping customer acquisition costs (CAC) low. The results have been impressive—a loyal driver base and high engagement.

**Traction:** Since its launch, Pronto has facilitated over 2 million trips and amassed more than 200,000 users. After bootstrapping to reach 500,000 trips, Pronto entered Y Combinator in the W19 batch, gaining significant visibility and support.

**Market Opportunity:** There are over 14,000 second-tier cities in Latin America, home to more than 500 million people who currently lack access to reliable ride-sharing and technology platforms. This vast market presents an enormous opportunity for growth.

**Team:** Based in Mexico City, Pronto operates with a team of 62 dedicated employees. Their passion and commitment to improving transportation options in their communities are palpable.

**Future Directions:** Pronto continues to expand both its user base and its service offerings. They aim to create a community-oriented platform where drivers can earn a good income on their own terms—without the burden of commissions.

2. **Invoicing and Payment Flexibility**: Parents can pay through multiple channels directly into their family's account, making fee payment straightforward and transparent.
3. **Financial Oversight Tools**: Schools gain access to a suite of tools, including payroll management, expense tracking, and categorization of vendor payments—all central to maintaining a smooth financial operation.

**Recent Developments**
Schoolable has debuted a new product aimed at enriching the experience of parents and their children. This launch forms part of their ongoing commitment to enhancing financial literacy and support for educational families, reinforcing their standing as a leader in education fintech.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W19,,,"Supernova connects to popular design editors and interprets design systems into data. These data can then be transformed in powerful ways to create code for product development, for literally any coding stack or platform imaginable. 

These transformations can be fully automated so that when design changes occur, the code is automatically updated to reflect the changes. Developers can fully control how the code is rendered, literally down to the individual code characters. An ecosystem of Supernova-developed and community-maintained code export packages is available for popular stacks and platforms via the Supernova Store, or teams can choose to create their own — for instance, to support proprietary frameworks or to customize code output to meet any company guidelines.",2016.0,[],"### Supernova: Bridging the Gap Between Design and Development

**Overview:**  
Founded in 2016 and part of Y Combinator's W19 batch, Supernova is a Prague-based company with a compact yet dynamic team of 20. Its mission is to create a design system platform that seamlessly connects developers and designers, enhancing collaboration and streamlining product development.

**Core Offering:**  
Supernova started with a simple yet powerful premise: to connect with popular design tools (like Figma) and convert design systems into actionable data. This data isn't just information; it's transformed into code that works across virtually any tech stack. What’s really striking here is the automation—when a design changes, the corresponding code gets updated without anyone lifting a finger.

Developers maintain precise control over the output, down to individual characters, which means customization is not only possible, it's encouraged. Supernova also offers a marketplace—the Supernova Store—packed with code export packages crafted by both the team and the community for popular frameworks. This flexibility allows teams to implement their proprietary systems or tweak existing templates to fit their guidelines.

**Why It Matters:**  
In a world where design and engineering often speak different languages, Supernova acts as a translator and unifier. By automating the updates from design changes to code, teams can focus more on creativity and less on mundane tasks. The platform not only facilitates communication but also provides extensive resources like documentation, integration options, and community support.

**Use Cases and Features:**
- **Seamless Integration:** Supernova connects with various tools in your existing ecosystem, making it easier for teams to find everything they need within their current workflows.
- **Code Automation:** Automated pipelines reduce human error during development. This is particularly useful for teams that rely on fast iteration cycles—like in agile environments.
- **Design System Management:** Supernova offers robust features for documentation and governance of design systems, ensuring consistency and clarity.
- **Enterprise Solutions:** Their features scale beautifully from startups to large enterprises, allowing organizations to manage complex design systems effectively.

**Customer Insight:**  
Clients have shared glowing reviews, emphasizing how Supernova not only serves as a reliable source of truth but also enhances collaboration. It's not just about creating documentation; it's about enabling teams to engage with the product actively and efficiently.

**Conclusion:**  
Supernova is more than just another tool in the developer's toolbox; it's a comprehensive solution aimed at accelerating the product development process by harmonizing design and engineering efforts. For any team looking to enhance collaboration and maintain flexibility in their design system, Supernova seems like a compelling option.

Founded in 2017 and based in San Francisco, Ultralight is shaking up the world of game and app development with its innovative approach to rendering HTML. As part of the Y Combinator Batch W19, this company has a clear mission: to provide a GPU-accelerated toolkit that makes embedding modern HTML in games and native applications not just feasible, but remarkably efficient. 

### What is Ultralight?

Ultralight is a lightweight fork of WebKit, designed specifically to empower developers using C and C++. Its reach extends across a broad array of platforms— from desktop systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux to gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation. The key value proposition? It's fast, lightweight, and portable.

### Why Ultralight Stands Out

1. **Ultra-Fast Rendering**: Ultralight distinguishes itself with a GPU-first architecture that can also utilize CPU rendering. Developers can choose to maximize performance by rendering directly on the GPU, or opt for easy integration with CPU-based rendering, suited for less intense environments.

2. **Ultra-Lightweight Resource Usage**: Ultralight's memory footprint is nearly ten times lighter than that of Chromium. This efficiency allows developers to create applications that consume fewer resources while maintaining strong performance.

3. **Ultra-Portability**: With optimization for various environments— including embedded systems and TVs— Ultralight fits seamlessly into many existing infrastructures. Whether you're developing a game or a desktop application, Ultralight is built to run nearly everywhere.

### Tailored for Game Developers

Ultralight’s development closely collaborates with leading AAA game studios, ensuring that it meets the demanding needs of modern game development. Some standout features include:

- **Deep GPU Integration**: The GPUDriver API allows developers to incorporate accelerated content directly into their existing rendering engines, whether they're using Direct3D, Metal, or OpenGL.

- **Transparent Rendering and Custom Image Compositing**: Rich web content can be rendered transparently over existing in-game visuals, enhancing the integration of HTML within the gaming experience.

### Native App Development Simplified

For native app developers, Ultralight offers straightforward integration with comprehensive support for consistent application performance across operating systems. Features like automatic window management and the ability to call native functions directly from JavaScript bridge the gap between web and native code.

### Trusted by Industry Leaders

Ultralight is already making waves with prominent partners, including major industry players like EA, Square Enix, and Sony, validating its efficacy in real-world applications.

### The Backstory

The team behind Ultralight is no stranger to this domain— they previously crafted Awesomium, the first HTML engine for games. Their journey took a bold turn in 2015 when they decided to move on from Chromium, focusing instead on performance and portability, which culminated in the creation of Ultralight and its private beta launch in 2018.

Check out their [website](https://ultralig.ht) to download the SDK, explore the documentation, engage in community discussions on Discord, and see how Ultralight can transform your development experience.

VotingWorks is a non-profit organization with a crucial mission: to build open-source voting machines for U.S. elections. Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch W19, VotingWorks is grounded in the belief that the system underpinning our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and they deserve assurance that elections are conducted freely and fairly.

#### The Problem with Current Voting Systems

Take a moment to consider that forty U.S. states still rely on voting machines that are over a decade old. These systems are not only outdated, but they also have proprietary source codes filled with vulnerabilities that have been flagged by security experts for years. A staggering 76% of voters are worried that elections could be hacked, and when trust in the electoral process wanes, democracy itself is at risk.

#### The VotingWorks Solution

VotingWorks aims to change that landscape by leveraging open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and contemporary product engineering. Their approach makes elections not only safer and more accessible but also significantly more affordable. Think about the many counties across the U.S. — especially those struggling financially — that need reliable election equipment but can't afford it. Ensuring that every county can implement up-to-date technology is a crucial part of safeguarding the democratic process.

#### What They Offer

1. **Voting Machines**: VotingWorks is the only provider of open-source voting systems in the U.S., designed to meet the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0. This ensures that every voter can independently verify and cast their ballot securely, either on paper or through a ballot marking device.

2. **Post-Election Audits**: They provide an open-source auditing tool that allows election officials to verify results by manually counting samples of paper ballots. Currently, ten states use this tool for various types of post-election audits.

#### The Team

Based in California, VotingWorks is a lean team of 18 dedicated professionals, guided by their Group Partner, Nan. Despite its size, the company is making significant strides in election technology, emphasizing transparency and trust.

#### Why It Matters

VotingWorks doesn’t just build technology; they are fostering a belief that elections can be conducted with the highest levels of security and integrity. By making their systems accessible and affordable, they are ensuring that the backbone of democracy remains strong.

Our vision is to develop non-hormonal contraceptives to provide both women and men with birth control options that lack the associated risks of hormone-based options but are equally effective. Traditionally, it has been the womenâs financial and health burden to have a contraceptive in place. Our first goal is therefore to  bring a novel non-hormonal, on-demand and low cost female contraceptive to the market that will substantially improve their quality of life and well-being. Our second goal is to develop the first ever non-surgical and highly effective non-hormonal contraceptive for men. Currently, male contraception is limited to two main options â vasectomy or condoms. Having such options available to both women and men will globally allow for much better family planning, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies including abortions and therefore reduce costs and ensure contraceptive health and well-being.",,[],"**YourChoice Therapeutics: Revolutionizing Contraception**

YourChoice Therapeutics is setting out to change the contraceptive landscape by focusing on non-hormonal birth control solutions. Founded in the Bay Area and backed by Y Combinator (Batch W19), this innovative company aims to address longstanding issues in contraceptive options that disproportionately burden women.

### Mission and Vision
The primary goal of YourChoice Therapeutics is to develop effective, non-hormonal contraceptives for both women and men. The company acknowledges that traditional options have often come with serious health risks and financial burdens, especially for women. Their vision? To provide equitable contraceptive choices that enhance the quality of life and well-being for all. 

**For Women:** The company is committed to bringing a novel, on-demand, and affordable contraceptive to the market that women can rely on without hormonal side effects. 

**For Men:** They are also venturing into male contraception, aiming to create the first effective, non-surgical contraceptive option. Right now, men have few choices—primarily vasectomies or condoms. A new solution here could lead to better family planning and less unplanned pregnancies, ultimately reducing societal costs associated with unwanted pregnancies and abortions.

### Current Developments
Located in Berkeley, CA, YourChoice Therapeutics consists of a tight-knit team of three, all laser-focused on research and development. They have reported compelling test results indicating their drug is 99% effective and entirely reversible, as demonstrated in animal studies. The non-invasive nature of their contraceptive approach means it could open up a new world of options for men—effectively allowing a temporary, daily regimen that surpasses the efficacy of condoms.

### Why It Matters
The implications of their work extend far beyond industry innovation; it's about social equity in reproductive health. By diversifying contraceptive options, YourChoice Therapeutics aims to empower individuals in shaping their family planning strategies while reducing the socially and financially burdensome consequences of unplanned pregnancies.

### Conclusion
