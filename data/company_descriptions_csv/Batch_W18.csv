Founded in 2014 and part of Y Combinator Batch W18, Callisto launched its online system in 2015, primarily operating across over 40 college campuses in the U.S. The company, based in San Francisco, aims to create technology that detects serial sexual offenders and connects survivors for mutual support.

The core of Callisto’s innovation lies in its unique platform, the Callisto Vault, which allows survivors to securely document their experiences and potentially match with others who may have encountered the same perpetrator. This way, survivors can gather strength in their shared experiences, fostering a sense of community and increasing accountability for serial offenders.

In 2020, Callisto expanded its offerings by integrating legal services with its matching escrow system, ensuring comprehensive support for survivors during a delicate time. This dual approach equips users not only with a safe space to report but also with legal avenues to explore if they choose to take action against their assailants.

With a small but dedicated team of just seven employees, Callisto has an ambitious mission: to extend its resources to every survivor in the country, facilitating a safer environment on campuses and ultimately reducing incidents of sexual assault.

Their overarching message is clear: Callisto exists to empower survivors and provide them with the tools and support they need to reclaim their narratives, making a significant stride toward a world where sexual violence is systematically addressed and perpetrators held accountable.

Founded in 2018 and proudly part of Y Combinator's Batch W18, Dear Brightly is tackling a common problem in skincare: access to effective, dermatologist-vetted prescription products. Located in the heart of San Francisco, with a compact team of three, this startup is making waves in the telehealth space by offering personalized skincare solutions with a tech twist.

The mission is simple yet impactful: to provide people with tailored, prescription-strength skincare that fosters healthy skin. This is done entirely online, eliminating the need for in-person dermatologist visits. The process is straightforward and user-friendly; customers share their skin goals via a secure telehealth portal, and then licensed doctors create a personalized serum, like their flagship product, the **Night Shift** retinoid serum. 

### Why Retinoids?

Prescription-strength retinoids, such as those offered by Dear Brightly, are significantly more potent than over-the-counter alternatives—around 20 times stronger, in fact. They’re the only FDA-approved treatment for photoaging, backed by over 50 years of research underscoring their efficacy and safety. For those seeking real results, this could make all the difference.

### The Experience

Starting your skincare journey is as easy as 1-2-3:
1. **Share Your Goals**: No need to visit a clinic; just upload some pictures and answer questions about your skin.
2. **Tailored Formulation**: A qualified dermatologist reviews your information and customizes a serum specifically for you.
3. **Ongoing Support**: Regular follow-ups with your skin coach ensure that you’re on the right track—just like a fitness routine, gradual progress is the key.

### Community Feedback

Clients rave about the ease of ordering, the quality of the product, and the responsiveness of dermatologists. Users have reported visible improvements in their skin within just a few weeks, highlighting the difference that a tailored regimen can make without unnecessary irritation.

Founded in 2018, Delphia is a Toronto-based fintech company that's carving out a niche in the investment world by leveraging consumer data to shape innovative investment strategies. As part of Y Combinator’s Batch W18, Delphia positions itself at the intersection of technology and finance, believing that in today’s AI-driven landscape, data isn't just a byproduct—it’s the most critical asset.

### Mission and Vision
Delphia's mission revolves around **quantitative investment strategies** enhanced by consumer data. They strive to empower both individuals and institutional investors by transforming proprietary data into actionable investment insights. The underlying philosophy is that actively managing people's data can unlock new forms of wealth creation—a game-changer for those willing to participate.

### What They Do
At its core, Delphia is about harnessing data to gain an edge in financial markets. This means using insights from various data sources—like credit card transactions and browsing habits—to inform investment decisions. Traditional hedge funds often leverage this type of consumer information to bolster their profits. Delphia aims to level the playing field, allowing everyday investors to benefit from their own data without needing to risk their capital directly.

### Key Milestones
- **2011-2018**: Delphia’s journey begins with its co-founders, who were already pioneering data-driven approaches to public opinion and predictive analytics long before they launched Delphia per se.
- **2019**: Transitioned from offering predictions to Wall Street to becoming a registered Investment Advisor with the SEC.
- **2021-2022**: Launched a market-neutral quant equity strategy, marking one of their best years in quantitative performance.
- **2023**: Helped to establish Superset, a Data Trust for fair data compensation, and open-sourced their backtesting framework, InvestOS.

### Looking Ahead
Delphia isn't resting on its laurels. With a team of about 20 employees led by seasoned professionals, including CIO Jonathan Briggs, they're continually innovating. The firm has exciting plans, including:
- **Tilt**: A new platform for trend-based investments.
- **Backchannel**: A venture enabling experts to monetize their knowledge.

Additionally, Delphia has recently shifted its focus to professional investors after refining its core offerings.

### Why Delphia Matters
In a world where your data is often considered a commodity, Delphia is pioneering a new path. They empower consumers by sharing profits from data insights, thus returning value to the very people generating the data. This approach not only democratizes access to investment strategies but promotes a fairer economic system.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W18,,,"If it isnât bad enough that smokers donât realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience â with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldnât carry around the sensation that theyâre stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isnât to encourage nicotine use among people who havenât started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isnât the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco â first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotineâs pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDAâs public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health â and reduce its costs â through a superior pure nicotine product.",2016.0,"[{'name': 'John Coogan, Founder', 'description': 'Entrepreneur typically focused on the technology side of consumer packaged goods.

Founded in 2016 and hailing from the heart of Los Angeles, Lucy Goods, Inc. is on a mission to eliminate the harmful effects of tobacco. The company emerged from the understanding that many nicotine products on the market are far from appealing—think of the pharmacy-style packaging of nicotine gum or the cumbersome aspects of vaping. Smokers deserve a better option, and that's where Lucy comes in.

### Mission and Vision

Lucy aims to tackle tobacco-related harm head-on. Their goal is not to promote nicotine use among newcomers but to provide a satisfactory alternative for those already using it. Their philosophy hinges on an evidence-based approach, recognizing nicotine’s enjoyment potential while prioritizing harm reduction over abstinence.

Every day, over 1,300 individuals die from tobacco-related illnesses in the U.S. Lucy believes it’s crucial to give nicotine consumers a more enjoyable, less harmful choice. By transitioning users to better-designed products, they hope to ease the burden of nicotine dependency and improve public health outcomes.

### Product Offerings

Lucy’s product lineup includes:

- **Breakers**: Innovative nicotine pouches that offer a unique hydrating experience.
- **Pouches**: High-capacity nicotine pouches available in various flavors.
- **Gum**: A revamped classic, this gum features improved flavor and texture that cater to a new generation of users.
- **Lozenges**: Small yet effective, these lozenges deliver nicotine satisfaction without burden.

The organization plans to seek approval for its offerings as clinically validated smoking cessation aids, participating in ongoing FDA discussions about nicotine replacement therapies. 

### Team and Affiliations

With a nimble team of just seven, Lucy Goods is part of Y Combinator's Winter 2018 batch, benefitting from the mentorship and networking opportunities that the accelerator provides. Dalton Caldwell serves as their Group Partner, guiding them in strategic directions as they grow.

### Culture and Branding

Lucy positions itself at the intersection of science and consumer health, often referring to its team as ""scientists, not cowboys."" They emphasize an intelligent, adult-focused approach to nicotine—a refreshing alternative in a market crowded with skimpily designed and marketed products.

### Conclusion

In summary, Lucy Goods, Inc. is redefining the nicotine experience, shifting the landscape from harmful habits to informed choices. Whether through innovative packaging, effective marketing, or evidence-backed efficacy, they’re striving toward a world where nicotine can be enjoyed with significantly less risk.

The **Mind Emulation Foundation** is an ambitious endeavor operating at the intersection of neuroscience and technology. Its primary mission is to research and develop the methods needed to emulate human minds digitally, enabling continuity of consciousness even after biological death. This goal is based on the profound idea that our essence—the ""you"" that you feel—stems from the intricate network of neural connections in your brain, known as the connectome.

### What They Do
The foundation is invested in various avenues of research surrounding mind emulation, primarily focusing on understanding and mapping the human connectome. This involves:

1. **Defining Mind Emulation**: It refers to the process of digitizing your connectome, allowing your thoughts and personality to potentially exist outside your biological body.
  
2. **Exploring Connectomics**: This subfield of neuroscience aims to uncover the complexities of the neural connections that make up the human brain.

3. **Investigating Scanning Techniques**: The foundation is looking into two primary methods of scanning the connectome:
   - **Destructive Scanning**: After biological death, the brain would be preserved and scanned at a nanometer resolution to reconstruct its connectome.
   - **Non-Destructive Scanning**: This approach seeks to map the connectome while a person is alive, with advancements in MRI technology paving the way.

4. **Establishing a Timeline**: While the precise timeline for implementing mind emulation is uncertain, some predictions suggest that our first human brain model could emerge around 2084, given the accelerated pace of technology.

5. **Community Engagement**: Through initiatives like the Mind Emulation Manifesto, the foundation fosters public discourse on the implications of mind emulation, advocating for its democratization and accessibility.

### The Future Outlook
With significant hurdles ahead, the Mind Emulation Foundation holds a cautiously optimistic outlook. They are not merely waiting for technological advancements; they actively contribute to research efforts. Supported by an ethos of scientific inquiry and accessibility, the foundation aims to pave the way towards a future where mind emulation becomes a reality, offering a second chance at existence.

Ovipost is on a mission to transform the insect farming industry through automation. Founded by entrepreneurs Trina Chiasson, who previously sold Infoactive to Tableau, and Teq Sassmannshaus, a seasoned biotech hardware engineer, Ovipost combines expertise in hardware, software, and biology to build automated insect farms. 

The rationale is straightforward: insects are incredible converters of abundant and inexpensive byproducts into high-quality protein. In the U.S., live insects represent a $175 million industry, but the bigger opportunity lies in replacing fishmeal—a $9.5 billion market— and other costly protein sources in animal feed using insects’ excellent amino acid profiles and superior digestibility.

Founded in 2018 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W18, Ovipost operates out of LaBelle, Florida, with a dedicated team of 20 employees. Their commitment to sustainable practices positions them well within the tags of biotech, climate tech, food tech, and agriculture.

The company produces a variety of live insects, including crickets, mealworms, superworms, roaches, and black soldier fly larvae, all cultivated in clean, controlled environments to ensure quality and safety. They emphasize that their insects are raised on premium, chemical-free diets, making them a reliable food source for pets like reptiles, birds, and amphibians.

Ovipost also prides itself on their customer service and satisfaction. With guaranteed live delivery and glowing testimonials, they have established a reputation for excellence in this niche market. 

Whether you’re a pet owner looking to provide the best nutrition for your animals or a company searching for sustainable protein alternatives in animal feed, Ovipost stands at the forefront of insect farming innovation.

Founded in 2018 and based in San Francisco, SafetyWing emerged from the Y Combinator W18 batch with a compelling mission: to provide health insurance tailored for remote teams and digital nomads. The company recognizes that traditional national welfare systems often fall short for the modern workforce, especially those embracing remote work lifestyles. 

SafetyWing is on a mission to build a global social safety net that caters to the unique needs of remote workers, a group that continues to expand around the globe. They aim to eliminate geographical barriers in access to health coverage, promoting equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of where they choose to live or work. 

**What They Offer**

SafetyWing offers two primary products:

1. **Nomad Insurance**: This is global travel medical insurance designed specifically for nomads and remote workers. It provides essential or comprehensive health coverage for individuals travelling abroad, addressing medical needs when away from home.

2. **Remote Health**: A holistic health insurance solution for companies with remote team members and contractors. This single group policy covers staff in over 175 countries, making it simpler for organizations to provide healthcare to a dispersed workforce.

**The Team & Culture**

With about 130 employees who are fully remote and distributed across six continents, SafetyWing embodies the principles it champions. This team model not only aligns with their mission but also enriches the products they develop, ensuring they remain relevant to a diverse global audience.

**Final Thoughts**

SafetyWing is redefining how we think about health coverage in a world that increasingly values flexibility, mobility, and remote work. Their innovative approach to forming a social safety net for a global workforce is not just timely—it's essential.

Sourcify is essentially a high-growth sourcing platform where brands can access a network of over 3,000 vetted factories across various product categories—be it fashion, home goods, or accessories.

- **Production Guides:** Detailed guides for different manufacturing hubs including India, Vietnam, and Mexico.
- **Factory Network:** Tools to find manufacturers based on specific needs.
- **Educational Resources:** Their Product Sourcing School provides valuable training, empowering individuals to source and manufacture their own products effectively.

**Why Sourcify Stands Out**

With a dedicated team of 15, Sourcify fosters a community centered on education and support. Their approach involves not just connecting brands with factories, but also providing continuous consultation through a localized support team, ensuring that clients navigate each step of the sourcing process without the typical headaches.

It’s about giving control back to the writers, where they own their content, mailing lists, and subscriber payments. This model hands the reins back to the creators, allowing them to connect directly with their audience without gatekeepers stifling their voices.

### Noteworthy Features

- **Editorial Freedom**: Full ownership of content without interference.
- **Revenue Sharing**: You earn, Substack earns.

Substack’s ethos invites creativity and builds communities, making it not just a platform, but a movement for the independent voice in a crowded digital landscape. You create, you connect, and ultimately, you create value for both yourself and your subscribers.

**Overview**  
Super is a pioneering social commerce platform based in Surabaya, Indonesia. Launched in 2018 as part of Y Combinator's Batch W18, Super aims to transform community interactions into a thriving e-commerce ecosystem. Its mission is clear: to empower community leaders to become retailers, making the shopping experience more accessible and efficient for everyday consumers.

**How it Works**  
At its core, Super operates much like a localized version of Pinduoduo, designed specifically for the Indonesian market. The platform facilitates community leaders—often small business owners—to source daily products at competitive prices and sell them within their neighborhoods through the Super app. The company leverages technology in three significant ways: 
1. **Price Comparison**: Helping community leaders find the best deals available.
2. **Logistics Network**: Building a cost-effective logistics system to ensure swift delivery of products.
3. **Communication**: Enhancing communication among buyers and sellers to nurture a social shopping experience.

**Key Features**  
- **Competitive Pricing**: Super promises pricing that benefits both retailers and consumers.
- **Accessibility**: Services extend to remote areas across East Java and Makassar.
- **Fast Delivery**: Orders are fulfilled quickly, often the next day, which adds a layer of convenience.
- **Free Shipping**: A significant incentive for consumers, making purchases more attractive.
- **Loyalty Programs and Promotions**: Users can earn points and redeem them for discounts, while flash sales offer further savings opportunities.

**Growth and Impact**  
With a burgeoning team of over 1,000 employees, Super not only serves as an essential marketplace but also acts as a community hub for retailers. It enables networking through WhatsApp groups where small shop owners can exchange tips and share promotional updates.

Super has garnered attention and accolades, being featured in Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" and recognized in the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 2023 awards. Investors backing Super include notable firms like Alibaba Cloud and Credit Suisse, reflecting strong confidence in its business model.

**Conclusion**

**Overview:**
Founded in 2017 and a proud Y Combinator W18 alumni, Tarjimly is a nonprofit based in Mountain View that has one clear mission: eliminating language barriers for refugees and immigrants worldwide. Their motto, ""Translating for Humanity,"" encapsulates their goal to enable communication for the 23 million refugees who struggle to navigate critical services like healthcare and legal aid.

**How It Works:**
Tarjimly leverages the skills of bilingual volunteers through a free mobile app, connecting them directly with those in need of translation and interpretation support. These interactions occur via chat, phone, or video calls, helping refugees and asylum seekers communicate effectively. Their services are not just limited to individuals; they also cater to NGOs, providing specialized, affordable translation services that prioritize hiring refugees themselves.

**Team and Impact:**
Despite a small team of four, Tarjimly has managed to make significant strides in humanitarian assistance. They’ve established a community of volunteers ready to assist in real-time, ensuring that vital information reaches the people who need it most. Their recent 2023 Impact Report showcases their growth and the effectiveness of their platform.

**Why Tarjimly?**
1. **Direct Connection:** Human interpreters can navigate the nuances of conversation, ensuring that critical information isn’t lost—a limitation often found in machine translations.
   
2. **Cultural Sensitivity:** The app’s human-driven support helps close cultural gaps, fostering understanding and empathy in sensitive situations.

3. **Flexibility for Volunteers:** Anyone with a smartphone and internet connection can volunteer their time without minimum time commitments. You simply respond to requests as they come in.

4. **Broad Reach:** From refugee camps to resettlement agencies, Tarjimly's services enhance communication across varied humanitarian settings. 

**Get Involved:**
Volunteers are always welcome at Tarjimly, and their need for more bilingual speakers is ongoing. Supporting Tarjimly can happen in several ways—volunteering, partnering, or making a donation.

**Conclusion:**
In a world rife with communication barriers, Tarjimly stands as a beacon of hope and understanding. They're not just translating words; they're translating lives and opportunities for a brighter future for refugees worldwide.
