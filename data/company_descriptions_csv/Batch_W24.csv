Founded in 2023 and a proud member of Y Combinator’s W24 batch, Argon AI, Inc. is on a mission to integrate artificial intelligence into the biopharma and life sciences sectors. The goal? To revolutionize how professionals execute complex, data-driven workflows using natural language processing. Simply put, Argon enables users to get comprehensive answers about clinical trials, existing treatments, the healthcare landscape, and competitive market analysis in a matter of minutes rather than the typical months.

### Team and Background

The leadership of Argon AI is impressive and seasoned:

- **Samy** has a background in data analytics from his stint at Flatiron Health (now part of Roche) where he spearheaded the first analytics project, recognizing the manual bottlenecks biopharma companies face. His insights not only propelled the Flatiron Services business but also helped secure over $6 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). His expertise lies in enterprise pharma sales, making him acutely aware of the industry's needs.

- **Cyrus** complements this with a robust engineering background, having built and led teams in both early-stage and established startups. He has experience in high-stakes environments, such as managing critical trade generation systems at Bridgewater, and possesses a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from USC.

### The Opportunity

The company’s mission is straightforward: to serve as an AI receptionist specifically tailored for dental practices. As we know, dental clinics often face the challenge of missed calls and overworked human receptionists, leading to a staggering 15% revenue loss. Arini addresses this gap by offering a AI system that answers phone calls and schedules appointments 24/7, ensuring that practices don’t miss out on potential patients.

The landscape of dental care is changing, heavily influenced by the recent surge in private equity investments which have empowered large dental groups to acquire thousands of clinics. This is where Arini’s strategy becomes particularly clever. By targeting these rapidly expanding dental groups that have standardized tech stacks, Arini positions itself perfectly to meet the needs of a growing market that is anticipated to dominate 40% of the U.S. dental market in just two years.

Currently a lean team of two, Arini is already capturing attention with its technology, which has resolved over 10,000 calls daily. The system integrates seamlessly with various existing dental management software, making it a versatile solution for many practices.

Pete Koomen, a partner at the firm, is leading this charge, and the early traction indicates that Arini’s technology not only helps increase revenue but also significantly reduces the need for additional hiring—creating a win-win scenario for dental practices.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W24,,,"Blacksmith helps companies run their continuous integration (CI) up to twice as fast, at half the cost. We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.

- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.
- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.
- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).

Blacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.

We are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).

Aayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively.

Founded in 2024 and backed by Y Combinator's W24 batch, Blacksmith is a company on a mission to transform how organizations handle Continuous Integration (CI). Their clever solution? Leveraging high-performance gaming CPUs to run CI workloads up to twice as fast—and at half the cost—compared to traditional hyperscaler options.

### The Problem with Current CI Solutions

For many engineering teams, the speed of CI processes can lag significantly as team sizes grow, leading to higher operational costs, especially when they rely on pricey hyperscalers. A common workaround is to use spot instances. While cost-effective, these can be unreliable—getting preempted at any time often requires extensive engineering efforts to manage.

### How Blacksmith Stands Out

Blacksmith swoops in as the antidote to sluggish, cumbersome CI systems. The company offers a seamless experience, allowing teams to run GitHub Actions—the leading CI platform—simply by making a one-line change in their codebase. The result? Access to lightning-fast CI without having to worry about scaling challenges.

Key features include:
- **High-Performance Gaming CPUs**: Blacksmith utilizes the latest gaming technology specifically optimized for CI workloads.
- **Effortless Setup**: With just one line of code, companies can significantly enhance their CI's speed and reliability.
- **Built-in Caching and Optimizations**: Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches and smarter handling of common CI tasks, such as building Docker images, making processes even faster.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Their platform includes powerful analytics to help users spot bottlenecks and improve CI performance.

### The Team Behind Blacksmith

The founders, Aayush, JP, and Aditya, are seasoned veterans from Cockroach Labs and Faire, where they witnessed first-hand the intensive resources that CI can consume. Armed with this experience, they set out to build a faster, cost-effective alternative that benefits companies aiming for lean operations.

### Why Choose Blacksmith?

- **Cost-Effective**: Their services are over 50% cheaper than conventional hosted runners.

**The Problem**  
Financial analysts spend an inordinate amount of time wrestling with data from Excel, PDF, and PPT files.

**Market Potential**  
With an ambitious vision to cater to over 100,000 investment teams, Centauri AI is poised to tap into a substantial market opportunity estimated at $5 billion. This potential is backed by early traction; since launching just a month ago, the company has initiated a successful pilot with a brokerage team at a public investment bank.

**Key Features**  
Centauri AI's platform stands out by offering:

- **Automated Data Processing:** Streamlined workflows that reduce repetitive tasks and enhance output quality.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Users can upload any file and receive processed data in moments.
- **Intelligent Data Mapping:** Sophisticated transformations that handle multiple files simultaneously, eliminating missing values or invalid fields.
- **Custom Queries and Analytics:** Analysts can make data queries using natural language and maintain a full citation of their projects, improving transparency and decision-making.

Yuki M, a Manager at a global insurance company, applauds Centauri AI for its ability to store corporate knowledge through customizable templates.

**Support and Backing**  
Centauri AI is not navigating these waters alone. The company is supported by key players like Microsoft for Startups, Y Combinator, NVIDIA Inception, and AWS Activate, providing a strong foundation for its growth.

Founded in 2023 and nestled in the bustling startup hub of San Francisco, Centralize is the brainchild of a small team of four, operating under the auspices of Y Combinator's Batch W24. Their mission is straightforward yet powerful: to serve as the all-in-one deal workspace for high Annual Contract Value (ACV) revenue teams.

### What They Do

Centralize initially aimed to help revenue teams navigate the complexities of multithreading. Think of it as giving sales reps the tools they need to build warmer pipelines with ease. Companies like Sendoso, mParticle, and Navattic have already embraced this platform, utilizing it for automating stakeholder mapping, tracking account priorities, and leveraging networks for warm introductions. This is not just a tool; it's a lifeline for sales professionals who want to remain competitive in today’s fast-paced environment.

### Features That Stand Out

1. **Automated Research**: Collect real-time insights from sources like 10-Ks and LinkedIn, saving your team countless hours.
   
2. **Relationship Intelligence**: Aggregate insights from calls and emails to ensure no important contact is ever missed.

3. **Network-Led Introductions**: Use your existing connections to secure warm leads from day one.

4. **Job Change Notifications**: Get alerts on key personnel changes within your buyer's committee—because timing matters in deal risk assessment.

5. **Dynamic Call Strategies**: AI-driven strategies that fine-tune your approach before every call, prioritizing the needs of each stakeholder.

6. **Seamless Integration with CRM**: With effortless syncing to tools like Salesforce, they ensure your team spends more time engaging with customers and less time on data entry.

### Who's It For?

Centralize caters to a diverse audience within the Go-To-Market (GTM) landscape:

- **Sales Reps** benefit by identifying and nurturing buyer committees in real time.
  
- **Sales Leaders** get an overview of every opportunity without getting bogged down in metrics.

- **Marketing Teams** can align efforts on Account-Based Marketing (ABM), driving more targeted campaigns.

- **Account Managers** rapidly pinpoint cross-sell and upsell opportunities based on customer interactions.

- **Customer Success Teams** maintain valuable insights on stakeholder engagement to ensure lasting customer loyalty.

### Getting Onboard

If you're looking to transform the way your sales team operates, Centralize is ready to help you ramp up. The pitch is simple: book a demo and see for yourself how you can exceed your quotas as a unified team.

Founded in 2024, Copper Health is a fresh player in the health-tech arena, emerging from the esteemed Y Combinator Batch W24. With its headquarters in San Francisco and a lean team of just two, Copper is on a mission to forge a modern patient engagement and remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) platform that’s reshaping physical therapy practices.

Initially developed as a comprehensive RTM solution for physical therapy, Copper Health leverages artificial intelligence to enhance patient compliance and satisfaction. Their platform is a win-win for clinicians and patients alike, promoting ongoing engagement and efficient communication while easing the administrative burdens typically associated with RTM.

**The Offerings:**
1. **AI-Powered Remote Therapeutic Monitoring**: Tailored specifically for physical therapists, Copper Health enables providers to earn meaningful reimbursements (up to $165 per patient monthly) while offering streamlined integration with various Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems.
   
2. **Seamless Setup**: Their solution is designed to be low-stress; therapists can enroll patients in mere seconds without tedious manual entry—the data management happens automatically, so clinicians can focus on patient care.

3. **Text-Based Engagement**: Forget cumbersome app downloads—patients can interact with the platform through simple text messages, keeping them engaged and informed about their home exercise programs.

**What Makes Copper Stand Out?**
The sheer convenience it provides is significant. Copper Health’s platform not only promises to simplify the RTM process but also actively enhances patient outcomes by facilitating continuous communication. As therapists track progress remotely, patients develop stronger relationships with their clinicians and feel more connected, which ultimately leads to better recovery rates.

**Feedback from Users**:
Testimonials from clinicians and patients dispel any doubt about Copper’s effectiveness. With rave reviews focusing on ease of use, seamless communication, and enhanced patient engagement, it’s clear that the platform is already making waves in therapy practices.

In a nutshell, Copper Health is not just another tech solution; it's a holistic approach to patient engagement that couples advanced technology with genuine care. With its strong foundations in AI and patient-centered design, it’s poised to transform how physical therapy is delivered—and how patients experience their recovery journey.

Counterintuitively, a significant majority—88%—of no-code users are programmers, which highlights a gap in accessibility.

2. **Connect Your Apps:** DryMerge identifies and guides users through connecting required apps securely.
3. **Let DryMerge Handle It:** Once set up, DryMerge takes care of the automation, keeping everything in sync without further input.

**Popular Use Cases:**  
DryMerge boasts a variety of pre-built workflows to streamline processes like managing customer data, coordinating emails and follow-ups, or syncing tasks across platforms.

**Integration Ecosystem:**  
It works with an array of popular tools, including Gmail, Google Sheets, Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Teams, and many more to enhance productivity across various functions—sales, marketing, support, and project management.

**Mission:**  
Glimmer aims to revolutionize the way professionals search through massive PDFs, leveraging AI to make the process 10 times easier. 

**The Problem:**  
If you've ever dealt with PDFs that are longer than 1,000 pages—think legal documents, construction reports, or lengthy financial filings—you'll know that traditional search methods (like ""Cmd-F"") are woefully inadequate. Sifting through hundreds of search results to find that one critical piece of information is not only frustrating but wastes valuable time for professionals across various industries.

**The Solution:**  
Glimmer turns this tedious task into a breeze. By using advanced AI, it indexes your large PDFs intelligently. Users can upload a PDF, then search it using natural language, receiving precise answers that are linked back to their original pages. This not only saves time but also enhances the accuracy of the information retrieved.

**Key Features:**

Founded in 2024 and based in San Francisco, GoldenBasis is a fintech startup on a mission to revolutionize the back-office software landscape for brokerages. Part of Y Combinator's Winter 2024 batch, this two-person team is addressing a significant pain point in the financial industry: how to manage the staggering $1.1 trillion in assets transferred annually between brokerages. Despite the size of this market, the tools used are often outdated, leading to inefficiencies and lost revenue from abandoned transfers. 

GoldenBasis is tackling this head-on by automating the complexities of back-office workflows with artificial intelligence. Their primary focus is on asset transfers, including both ACATs (Automated Customer Account Transfers) and non-ACATs, which often require manual intervention. Their solution allows brokerages to free up operations teams, streamline processes, and ultimately improve the client onboarding experience.

**Core Features:**
- **Transfer Command Center:** This feature empowers operations teams to monitor and manage transfers effectively, handling exceptions seamlessly while maximizing automation.
- **Robust API Integration:** GoldenBasis offers a powerful set of APIs that link directly with brokerage systems, enabling customized solutions for unique operational requirements.
- **AI-Powered Data Validation:** By leveraging AI, GoldenBasis improves the accuracy of data entry during the transfer process, significantly reducing errors and confusion for both clients and operations staff.

**Why They Matter:**
GoldenBasis stands out in the crowded fintech space by not only modernizing back-office operations but also enhancing client experiences through real-time transfer tracking and simplified onboarding processes. Their approach is particularly beneficial for self-clearing broker-dealers, wealth management firms, and related entities looking to improve operational efficiency and client satisfaction.

**Funding and Support:**
Backed by leading investors and boasting a team with expertise from top financial and tech institutions, GoldenBasis is both well-funded and well-positioned to make a substantial impact.

In short, GoldenBasis is focused on transforming the outdated paradigms of brokerage operations into a more efficient, automated future, ramp-ready for the demands of modern finance. For brokerages eager to enhance their operations and client experiences, connecting with the GoldenBasis team might just be the next smart move.

Founded in 2023 and based in New York, Hatchet is a cutting-edge company that specializes in background task orchestration and visibility. As a proud member of Y Combinator Batch W24, Hatchet is reshaping how developers handle task queues and message brokers. The vision? To streamline your focus on writing background task logic, leaving the heavy lifting of infrastructure management to Hatchet.

**What Does Hatchet Do?**

Think of Hatchet as a distributed task queue that simplifies the process of creating resilient web applications. It tackles issues like concurrency, fairness, and durability with ease. Its features allow developers to run slow OpenAI requests as asynchronous tasks, chain complex workflows, and implement retries and timeouts to recover from failures.

**Key Features:**
1. **Fault-Tolerant Architecture**: Hatchet replaces traditional message brokers, making distributed operations smoother and more reliable.
2. **Fairness for Users**: Whether for generative AI or batch processing documents, Hatchet ensures that resources are allocated equitably across users—this is especially useful in high-demand environments.
3. **High Throughput**: With an average startup latency of just 25ms, it promises low-latency scheduling and high throughput, essential for real-time applications.
4. **Flexible Workflows**: Using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), developers can design complex workflows that can also resume mid-job on failure.

**Open-Source and Community-Centric**

Emphasizing open-source collaboration, Hatchet invites the community to get involved. You can check out their [GitHub page](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet) to contribute, raise issues, or simply star the project.

**Getting Started**

For developers eager to try Hatchet, the process is straightforward:
1. **Register your functions** using the SDK available in Python, Typescript, and Go.
2. **Start a Hatchet worker** to listen for events.
3. **Run your tasks** by pushing events into the system.

This simplicity is designed to keep your focus on the core logic without getting lost in the technical weeds.

**The Team and Support**

**Founding and Mission**  
Founded in 2023 and part of the Y Combinator Batch W24, InspectMind AI is based in San Francisco and boasts a nimble team of 10. The company’s mission is elegantly simple: to write building inspection reports using artificial intelligence—up to 100 times faster than traditional methods. 

**What It Does**  
InspectMind AI is transforming the construction landscape by simplifying documentation for builders and designers. Imagine being able to capture site information through a few swift taps on your phone, whether by taking photos or recording voice notes. The AI then processes this input and generates comprehensive, well-formatted inspection reports, often ready by the time you leave the job site. Gone are the days of spending hours, sometimes even days, on tedious report writing.

**Key Features and Benefits**  
1. **Rapid Report Generation**: InspectMind automates the transformation of voice and visuals into clear, user-friendly inspection documents, allowing for an impressive 80% reduction in report creation time.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Stay updated on job site progress effortlessly, ensuring deadlines are met without the hassle of manual tracking.
3. **Safety Compliance**: The platform incorporates advanced AI for proactive safety monitoring and compliance.

**How It Works**  
1. **Record the Inspection**: Users start their inspections using the app, snapping photos and recording voice notes.
2. **AI-Driven Report Creation**: Once the inspection is complete, the AI extracts crucial details and formulates a report based on the user’s input.
3. **Review and Refine**: Reports can be reviewed and modified within the app, with all notes securely stored in the cloud.
4. **Share Instantly**: Shared links or downloadable formats (Word or PDF) make distribution easy.

**User Experience**  
InspectMind is designed by architects and engineers who understand that while site visits are engaging, report writing can be a burden. To illustrate, Amarendra Prasad, a structural engineer with 35 years of experience, notes that the app has been a ""game-changer"" in his workflow, allowing him to spend less time on reports and more time where it matters—on-site.

**Vision for the Future**  
InspectMind aims to continuously enhance its platform through the latest advancements in AI technology, incorporating large language models and advanced computer vision for even higher standards in construction inspections.

For those looking to streamline their reporting processes and enhance productivity in the construction industry, InspectMind AI is clearly worth a look.

This company emerged from Y Combinator Batch W24 and operates with a lean team of just three employees, suggesting they're tackling a big problem with agility.

So what's their mission? It’s straightforward: **help CPG brands automatically flag and dispute invalid retail fees.** Retailers often impose fees that can be erroneous or inflated, and sifting through these deductions can consume a lot of time and manpower. Intercept's platform streamlines this process by ingesting data from brand fees across retailer portals and emails. It flags fees that are ripe for dispute and automates the mundane tasks tied to these disputes, reducing what once required a team effort to the capability of a single individual.

They describe their solution in a three-step process: **Categorize, Resolve, and Reconcile.** The platform automates the categorization of deductions, flags invalid ones using AI, and even reconciles everything with the brand’s accounting systems. It’s a powerful blend of technology with a human touch; each client gets the support of a dedicated deductions analyst who ensures everything is expertly verified.

Intercept is already seeing some buzz, backed by endorsements from high-growth retail brands, including use cases that highlight how quick and effective their solution is. One testimonial from Vosges Haut-Chocolat notes that the platform helped tackle an impressive backlog of deductions in just days and resulted in a significant recovery of funds. 

Their thinking around onboarding is refreshingly simple—most integrations can be accomplished in under an hour, making it welcoming for brands concerned about time-to-value. Plus, the promise of advanced analytics could turn these deduction disputes into an opportunity for deeper insights into distribution centers, customer behavior, and product performance.

In summary, Intercept is not just another tech company; it's a solution empowering CPG brands to reclaim lost revenue and manage what used to be an arduous task with ease.

As a participant in Y Combinator's Winter 2024 batch, it aims to consolidate the workflow between design and development with its tagline: ""Your front end team in a box."" 

**What They Do:**
At its core, ion is all about automation and efficiency for early-stage companies. The platform allows teams to turn their Figma designs into a tailored React codebase swiftly and seamlessly. By simply describing a user interface (UI) in text or adjusting design specifications in Figma, users can receive corresponding code that aligns beautifully with their existing design systems. This means less time is wasted interpreting design elements, and teams can focus on building their product.

**How it Works:**
1. **Design Description to Code**: Startups can input simple text descriptions or design requests, and in return, the ion platform generates precise React code.
2. **Figma Integration**: Once a company has scaled up and potentially hired design talent, ion transforms Figma designs—leveraging the company’s unique design system—into clean and manageable React code.
3. **Component Reuse**: It smartly reuses existing components and code variables, thus integrating with the developer's workflow and automatically generating pull requests (PRs) for any necessary code updates or conflicts arising from design changes.

**The Team**: With a compact, agile team of two, ion design operates under the experienced guidance of Dalton Caldwell, a Group Partner at Y Combinator. 

**Why Choose ion?** 
The company positions itself as more than just a code conversion tool. By reducing the repetitive and often cumbersome tasks involved in front-end development, ion empowers designers and developers to enhance productivity and focus on the larger picture—building scalable, innovative products.

**Key Features:**
- Quick turnaround time from design to code.
- Seamless integration with the established coding environment.
- Significant time savings—averaging 10+ hours per week for developers—allowing them to escape the mundane aspects of styling.

**In Summary:**
ion design is not just another software tool; it's a transformative platform that bridges the gap between design and development, fostering efficiency and quality in the coding process. If you're in the early stages of building and looking to streamline your design-to-development pipeline, ion might just be the game-changer you need.

Founded in 2023 and based in London, Konstructly is carving out a niche in the construction industry. Their mission? To build “The Modern Operating System for Construction.” They’re not just another startup; they’re tackling one of the biggest pain points in construction: the disconnect between payment processes and actual work done.

### The Problem They're Solving

Construction projects often fall victim to overspending. Why? Because the back office—the folks handling payments—often doesn’t have real-time visibility into what’s happening on-site. Konstructly bridges that gap. By linking payment approvals directly to work quality checks and live progress updates, they offer a clearer view into what’s been built and how much should be paid.

### What They Offer

At its core, Konstructly provides a suite of smart software tools that digitize invoicing and payment approval processes:
- **Change Management**: Effortlessly link subcontractor Site Instructions to variations and costs. Everything’s in one place, so nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Valuations & Payment Applications**: Streamlined payment applications mean you can value them in just two clicks. Automation takes care of the tedious stuff.
- **Live Build Progress**: Capture real-time updates, ensuring that the valuation process is robust and reflective of true site progress.
- **Quality Assurance**: Hold back payments if necessary, tying quality issues directly to payment stages. This creates a productive environment for subcontractors, incentivizing them to maintain high standards.

### The Team and Support

With a lean team of just six, Konstructly is part of the Y Combinator Batch W24, under the guidance of Group Partner Brad Flora. They’re building a community around this innovative software, already trusted by various contractors across the UK. 

### Looking Ahead

The construction industry is ripe for disruption, and with Konstructly’s approach, they’re not just photobombing the space; they’re redesigning the whole framework. If you’re involved in construction, this is a tool that promises efficiency, transparency, and ultimately, savings. Curious to see it in action? Head over to their [website](https://konstructly.com/) and request a demo.

**Founders and Origins:**  
Lantern was founded in 2023, fueled by a belief that AI is set to transform enterprises across all sectors. Located in the heart of San Francisco and part of Y Combinator Batch W24, Lantern aims to simplify AI application development using a technology many developers are already familiar with: Postgres.

**Mission Statement:**  
Lantern's mission is clear – to make it easy for businesses to harness their unstructured data and build sophisticated AI applications. As data continues to proliferate, Lantern positions itself as a bridge between raw data and meaningful insights, leveraging the capabilities of Postgres as its backbone.

**What Lantern Offers:**  
With **Lantern Cloud**, developers gain access to a powerful toolkit designed for building AI applications. This includes:

- **Embedding generation:** Seamlessly create embeddings for your data.
- **Vector compression and search:** Optimize and search vast datasets efficiently.

Founded in 2024 as part of Y Combinator's Winter 2024 batch, Leaping is tackling a problem that plagues software engineers everywhere: the time and resources wasted on bug fixing. Based in San Francisco, this fledgling startup has a lean team of just two employees, but they are on a mission that resonates with many in the tech industry.

The premise is simple yet powerful: when poorly written software hits the market, it can cost companies dearly in both finances and reputation. Many software engineers often find themselves spending more time fixing code than actually writing it. As AI-powered coding assistants become more prevalent, this trend is likely to worsen unless something changes. That's where Leaping steps in.

Leaping's approach focuses on autonomously diagnosing the root causes of bugs and generating tested code fixes automatically. This could save developers a significant amount of time and streamline the debugging process, allowing them to concentrate more on writing innovative code and less on fixing issues.

Their tagline, ""Fix your bugs, automatically,"" encapsulates their unique value proposition in the burgeoning fields of developer tools and AI-assisted programming. It's a bold aim, and with backing from influential figures like Michael Seibel as their Group Partner, they seem well-positioned to disrupt the traditional debugging landscape.

If you're a software engineer tired of the endless cycle of bug fixes or a company looking to improve your software reliability without burning through cash and trust, keep an eye on Leaping. You can learn more about them at [leaping.io](https://www.leaping.io/).

**Location and Team:** Based in Paris, France, Malibou currently operates with a lean team of just two employees and is backed by Brad Flora as a Group Partner. 

**Product Offering:** Malibou's software provides a plethora of features designed to alleviate headaches associated with payroll and HR management. Some key capabilities include:
- Instant payroll processing and compliance checks
- Time management to oversee working hours and compensation
- Centralized management for absences and remote work
- Structured interview campaigns with templates
- Expense tracking and reimbursements
- Direct chat support with a dedicated payroll expert

**Target Market:** The software caters to various company sizes, be it 5-20 employees, 20-50 employees, or over 50 employees, making it suitable for a wide range of SMBs in France.

**Tags:** Malibou is tagged as B2B, productivity, HR-tech, payroll, and SMB.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W24,,,"Close customer support tickets faster with AI.

We’re building AI infrastructure to power customer support at scale. With Markprompt, companies can automate customer support, scale without increasing headcount, and deliver exceptional user experiences.

Scaling customer support with headcount is expensive, with human resources accounting for 90%+ of customer support expenses. On top of that, customer support agents often burn out leading to turnover and reduced quality. As companies grow, so does their expert knowledge, which is hard to access at scale and makes keeping employees up-to-date nearly impossible.

Markprompt addresses the root of the information access problem by indexing all available knowledge within a company, setting the foundation for a robust system of record to feed the AI. Built from the ground up with an API-first approach, Markprompt provides SDKs (such as React hooks and components) and no-code tools to enable integrations at all touchpoints in the customer journey.",2023.0,"[{'name': 'Marie Schneegans, Founder', 'description': 'Co-founder of Markprompt.\n\nMarie and Michael previously founded Motif, a collaborative docs platform based on Markdown and React.

Founded in 2023 and based in San Francisco, Markprompt is at the forefront of using AI to enhance customer support. As part of Y Combinator’s Batch W24, this lean startup, with a current team of just two, aims to dramatically reduce the costs and inefficiencies associated with traditional customer support.

### Mission and Approach

Markprompt’s core mission is simple yet ambitious: *AI for customer support*. Picture the typical support operation, with human agents shouldering the massive burden of ticket handling. This method isn't just costly—it’s also prone to burnout and turnover. Markprompt is designed to tackle these issues head-on, providing a scalable AI infrastructure that helps companies automate their support processes effectively. 

Utilizing an API-first architecture, Markprompt allows for smooth integration across various customer journey touchpoints through SDKs and no-code tools. The company seeks to index internal knowledge to create a robust system from which their AI can draw insights, ensuring not only efficiency but exceptional user experiences.

### Product Offering

Markprompt specializes in creating enterprise-grade AI agents that streamline and automate customer support tasks. Here’s what they bring to the table:

- **Email Agents:** Handle incoming customer inquiries automatically, gathering necessary details and crafting responses before they even reach human agents' queues.
- **Chatbots:** Deliver round-the-clock support via web chat, in-app messages, and social media, resolving issues in real-time and reducing wait times.
- **Voice Support:** AI-powered agents ready to provide human-like assistance over the phone, ensuring customer satisfaction with accurate and timely answers.
- **Routing Agents:** Optimize ticket management by identifying the right experts for specific issues, effectively reducing resolution times.
- **Agent Assist:** Enhance human agents’ capabilities inside platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce by automating responses and case triaging.
- **Reporting and Compliance:** Automated systems for monitoring, data analysis, and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards, with a focus on security.

### The Big Picture

Markprompt understands that scaling customer support traditionally means hiring more people, which isn’t sustainable. Their solution not only minimizes the necessity of increasing headcount but also empowers support teams to focus on more complex inquiries, leaving routine tasks to the AI. 

With impressive results, such as Vercel's reported 31% reduction in human-handled tickets, Markprompt is demonstrating the potential for AI to reshape enterprise support operations across sectors, particularly in fintech and developer platforms.

### Security and Compliance

In a world where data privacy is paramount, Markprompt is SOC 2 Type II certified and GDPR compliant, with advanced features like data encryption and PII removal for safeguarding sensitive information.

### Conclusion

If you're looking to redefine your customer support landscape through innovative AI solutions, Markprompt is an intriguing contender worth exploring. Whether through seamless integration into your existing systems or comprehensive automation of support tasks, they position themselves as a partner in scaling support operations while maintaining high-quality service standards.

This San Francisco-based startup, part of Y Combinator's Batch W24, is spearheaded by Han and Dave, the visionary team behind Vlingo, the technology that powered the first Siri app—acquired for a cool $225 million. They've taken their deep expertise in speech technology and turned their sights on transforming voice interactions in business.

### What They Do

At the core of Marr Labs’ offering is **Vox**, an AI voice agent designed to manage a wide range of phone-based tasks. From answering customer calls and scheduling appointments to handling sales and customer service inquiries, Vox can do it all at a fraction of the cost of human agents. This system taps into a massive opportunity: businesses in the U.S. handle around **17 billion calls** annually, costing an average of **$5 per call**, which translates into an **$85 billion** market. That's a big pie, and Marr Labs aims to grab a generously sized slice.

### What Makes Vox Special?

Vox is equipped with **Symphonia**, Marr Labs' proprietary conversational intelligence platform. Symphonia enhances Vox’s capabilities, enabling it to learn and adapt to specific business needs. Think of it as Vox's brain, embedded with advanced features like **ML Turbo** and **ML Reason**—the very components that allow Vox to converse naturally while essentially holding an “instant PhD” in Sales, Support, and Scheduling.

### Target Industries

Initially focusing on the **mortgage sector**, where speed and responsiveness can be the difference between landing a deal or losing it to competitors, Vox promises to accelerate lead conversions and streamline processes with its human-like interactions.

But Marr Labs isn't stopping there. They're also eyeing the **healthcare sector**, hinting at future applications that could further push the boundaries of conversational AI.

The company's mission is straightforward but powerful: to help stock brokerages settle trades instantly. In an era where speed and efficiency are paramount, NowHouse is positioning itself as a vital player in the trading infrastructure landscape.

The firm operates from an undisclosed location—likely to maintain a low profile early on—and currently has a team that’s still taking shape as it builds out its operations. Jared Friedman, a well-known venture partner, is backing them, which lends some credence to their ambitious goals.

What makes NowHouse particularly interesting is how it combines traditional finance with modern technology. They're not just another software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering; they're deeply integrated into the user experience of stock trading. By focusing on features instead of just ledgers, they provide high throughput and low-latency reads and writes, ensuring that transactions are processed with blazing speed.

NowHouse addresses a significant pain point in trading by enabling instant settlement and reducing reliance on cumbersome daily reconciliations typically handled by custodians. Their platform allows firms to create multiple ledgers tailored to various investment strategies and asset classes, giving traders unprecedented visibility and control over their positions, including real-time tracking of trade or funding progress.

Moreover, compliance appears to be a strong pillar of their service. NowHouse is SOC 2 compliant and adheres to SEC Rule 17 and FINRA Rule 4511, which are essential for any firm operating in the finance sector.

In short, NowHouse is establishing itself with a clear intent: to simplify and streamline the post-trade process for brokerages in an increasingly complex financial landscape. This focus on real-time accuracy and regulatory compliance could make them a game changer for firms looking to enhance their trading operations. Keep an eye on them as they develop; they could very well shape the future of how trading is executed and settled.

#### Overview
Founded in 2024 and based in the tech hub of San Francisco, Octolane AI is on a mission to revolutionize customer relationship management. Part of Y Combinator’s W24 batch, this sprightly startup aims to create an ""AI-first Salesforce."" What does that mean?

Their journey is a testament to resilience and an eagerness to take risks in pursuit of innovation.

The team is noted for its tireless work ethic—they're not clocking out at 4 PM like many in the industry. Instead, they’re committed to scaling their product and supporting their customers even on weekends. It’s this kind of mentality that creates a palpable excitement around Octolane as they're riding the wave of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the AI market.

#### Why It Matters
In a world where businesses are inundated with data yet often paralyzed by it, Octolane AI represents a break from the norm.

As part of the Y Combinator Batch W24, OffDeal aims to provide small business owners with a streamlined, efficient, and cost-effective way to sell their companies, maximizing sale prices while minimizing traditional headaches.

### Mission

OffDeal’s mission is straightforward: to empower small business owners with the tools to sell their companies quickly and at premium prices. By leveraging advanced AI technology, OffDeal automates the grunt work typically associated with larger Wall Street banks, freeing their M&A advisors to engage more meaningfully with clients. This not only enhances the selling experience but also improves outcomes for both sellers and buyers.

### The Approach

OffDeal utilizes a custom AI algorithm that analyzes over 25,000 past mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions to identify the best potential buyers for your business. This results in several key advantages:

- **Higher Sales Prices**: Their AI identifies strategic buyers who appreciate the true value of your business.
- **Faster Transaction Times**: OffDeal aims to close deals within six months, often securing Letters of Intent (LOIs) in under 60 days.
- **Increased Confidentiality**: They focus outreach only on vetted, curated buyers, ensuring your privacy is maintained throughout the process.

### The Team and Leadership

With a lean team of just two members, OffDeal is guided by industry expertise and the leadership of Nicolas Dessaigne as their Group Partner. This compact but skilled team ensures that clients receive personalized attention and strategic guidance.

### Fee Structure and Services

OffDeal operates on a success-based fee model, meaning clients pay only when their business is sold. This aligns the interests of the advisory team with those of the sellers, motivating them to secure the best possible exit value. Their services include:

- **Free Discovery & AI Matching**: Initial evaluations and buyer lists are provided quickly.
- **Comprehensive Evaluations**: Data-driven insights help prepare businesses for sale.
- **Expert Guidance**: Ongoing support ensures a smooth transition throughout the selling process.

### Target Market

Founded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator's W24 batch, Penciled is a San Francisco-based startup on a mission to help physical therapists fill 10 times more canceled appointments. At the heart of its offering is an AI agent named Nicole—think of her as a virtual assistant dedicated to maintaining therapist schedules while ensuring patients receive prompt communication.

**How Does It Work?**
Nicole's capabilities are impressive. She manages waitlists and keeps track of live appointment availabilities, reaching out to patients via text and calls. When deployed, she fills around 79% of detected cancellations in under three minutes. The results speak for themselves: therapists using Nicole have seen a staggering 194% increase in their ability to fill canceled appointments.

**Why Should You Care?**
Appointment cancellations can significantly dent a therapist’s income and the patient’s care continuity. Penciled's AI not only mitigates this issue but also allows for a more seamless clinic operation. Clinics report saving roughly $3,000 per location per month by using Nicole, plus the added benefit of needing fewer front-office staff. This means therapists can focus more on patient care rather than playing phone tag—an efficiency boost that doesn’t just streamline processes but improves patient engagement.

**Team and Support**
Despite being a small team of two, they are backed by Y Combinator and have the mentorship of Gustaf Alstromer, a noted figure in startup circles. Penciled's growth trajectory suggests that even with a lean setup, significant market impact is achievable.

**The Bigger Picture**
Penciled exemplifies how AI can streamline administrative tasks in healthcare, allowing human professionals to do what they do best: provide excellent patient care. As the healthcare landscape becomes increasingly data-driven, solutions like Penciled are poised to lead the charge in operational efficiency.

If you’re in the physical therapy field and facing challenges with appointment no-shows, it might be worthwhile to check out Penciled.

Thanks to a seamless two-click integration and 60-second deployment, Petra's software can be up and running without disrupting a business’s daily operations. This means organizations can keep their employees engaged and working while ensuring their digital environment remains secure.

### The Promise of Efficiency

The company emphasizes speed and reliability in threat detection. They boast the fastest mean time to detect (MTTD) in the industry, ensuring that threats are neutralized before they can escalate. This performance is not just about rapid response; it’s also about the value they provide to corporate clients by ensuring business continuity during attacks.

Petra's commitment extends beyond mere detection. They provide thorough security assessments and detailed reporting tailored for executives and tech teams alike, allowing organizations to understand their security posture clearly.

PointOne is a startup on a mission to transform the way law firms handle time tracking and billing. Founded in 2023 and a participant in Y Combinator's W24 batch, this innovative company aims to alleviate the cumbersome process of manual time tracking that has long plagued attorneys. 

Historically, lawyers have to document their work in 6-minute increments—an administrative nightmare that not only wastes time but also leads to revenue loss due to untracked hours. PointOne harnesses the power of AI to completely automate this process, enabling law firms to accurately capture billable hours effortlessly. The recent feedback from their early adopters indicates they’re saving attorneys significant time each week, allowing them to focus more on client work rather than tedious billing tasks.

Currently headquartered in an unspecified location, PointOne operates with a lean team of three. Their product not only automates time entries but also reviews bills, ultimately helping firms boost their billable time by an average of 3-10%. In a legal landscape where every dollar counts, this is no small feat.

As of now, PointOne has secured $3.5 million in seed funding to further develop their platform. Their Group Partner, Dalton Caldwell, lends his experience to help guide the company's growth strategy.

The platform offers a holistic solution that includes features like automatic time capture, retroactive entries, customizable billing rules, and seamless integration with existing billing and practice management systems. They are firmly committed to security, boasting SOC 2 certification and robust infrastructures that ensure client data is kept safe.

Founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's W24 batch, Pythagora leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to build complete applications from scratch—just by having a conversation with you. 

Imagine this: You have an idea for an app. With Pythagora, you begin by describing your vision. Our robust IDE extension, built on the open-source GPT Pilot—which boasts over 22,000 stars on GitHub—will guide you through the process by asking the right questions to flesh out your app specifications. Once you have a plan, Pythagora goes to work, coding in real-time and iterating based on your feedback. Think of it as having a coding partner that not only writes the code but also learns along the way, making adjustments until it aligns with your requirements. When everything is up to your standards, it commits the code and moves on to the next task.

Functionally, Pythagora simplifies the entire development workflow, including debugging and refactoring, directly integrating into tools like VS Code. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a newcomer looking to dip your toes in coding without prior experience, Pythagora makes the development process feel more collaborative—like a pair programming session where the AI is genuinely there to support you, rather than hinder.

The company currently operates with a lean team of six and is spearheaded by Nicolas Dessaigne, a notable partner at Y Combinator. It offers multiple pricing tiers, starting with a free plan to allow users to explore its capabilities, moving up to Pro and Premium plans that cater to more serious endeavors.

Real-world applications already demonstrate Pythagora’s effectiveness. From custom HR tools automating complex hiring processes to A/B testing solutions for marketing, the feedback from users has been overwhelmingly positive. Developers are reporting significant time savings—what once took days can now be accomplished in mere hours.

In essence, Pythagora is not just a tool; it's a new paradigm in app development that empowers you to create faster, learn as you go, and ultimately, bring your software ideas to life with a newfound ease.

**Overview:**
Founded in 2023 and a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch W24, Relari is a fresh player focusing on the testing and simulation stack for Generative AI (GenAI) systems. With a tight-knit team of just two, they're shaking things up in the AI landscape by offering powerful tools that enable AI development teams to simulate, test, and validate complex applications. 

**Mission:**
Relari is on a clear mission: to simplify the testing and validation process for GenAI systems. They help AI teams assess their applications rigorously throughout the development lifecycle, improving reliability and effectiveness at each stage.

**Core Offering:**
At the heart of Relari's platform is **continuous-eval**, an open-source modular evaluation framework that provides detailed metrics for various Large Language Model (LLM) applications, including text and code generation, retrieval, classification, and agent behavior. 

The cloud-based platform stands out by generating custom synthetic data and simulating user behavior to stress test GenAI applications. This approach means developers can identify weaknesses and fortify their solutions even before deployment.

**Agent Contracts:**
One of the standout features is the concept of **Agent Contracts**. This intuitive, natural-language way of describing an AI agent's expected behaviors serves two purposes:
1. It helps define the agent's purpose clearly.
2. It allows developers to create automated tests that verify compliance with the expected behavior, streamlining the debugging process.

Relari addresses this gap, enabling a robust toolkit for creating agents that not only perform well but do so in a predictable and verifiable manner.

### Pricing Structure:
Relari offers a tiered pricing model:

- **Community**: Free for individual developers and researchers looking for open-source metrics.
- **Starter**: Ideal for developers wanting access to a broader suite of tools for free.
- **Team**: $1,000/month for teams looking to deploy reliable applications at scale.

Their platform promises quick document ingestion—handling over 40 formats ranging from PDFs to audio files—and advanced document intelligence, which automatically uncovers hidden relationships within your data through knowledge graphs. They focus on three core features:

1. **Universal Document Processing**: Process millions of documents swiftly. 
2. **Enterprise Access Control**: Secure document sharing with detailed permission settings, making collaboration seamless.
3. **Advanced Document Intelligence**: Enrich context and automate insights extraction, turning raw data into actionable knowledge.

**Overview**  
Starlight Charging, founded in 2022 and based in Austin, TX, is at the forefront of revolutionizing electric vehicle (EV) charging with a focused mission: providing ultra-low-cost charging solutions specifically for condominiums and apartment complexes. Their innovative approach aims to significantly lower the financial barrier associated with establishing EV charging stations.

**The Problem and Solution**  
Traditionally, installing EV chargers in residential buildings has been bogged down by the hefty expenses of infrastructure upgrades. Starlight solves this with their proprietary power-balancing software, which allows for efficient installations without the need for costly electrical upgrades—effectively slashing installation costs by an impressive 10 times compared to conventional methods.

**Partnership Potential**  
Starlight isn't just another service; it's a platform. Through their Partner Program, they've created a pathway for electricians and small business owners to set up their own charging networks. This innovative initiative allows these partners to install chargers and earn passive income through ownership of these stations, supported by Starlight’s reliable software.

**Products and Offerings**  
Starlight Charging features several key products:  
- **Turnkey Charging**: A complete package including project design, financing, and installation of chargers—all with minimal hassle for property owners.  
- **Charger Management Software (CSMS)**: This tool enables revenue collection from any OCPP-connected charger, centralized in one intuitive dashboard.  
- **Starport 1.0**: An ultra-low-cost Level 2 charger specifically designed for high-density living environments like apartments and condos.

**Team and Support**  
The Starlight team is lean, housing just three core members, and is guided by Gustaf Alstromer, a Group Partner from Y Combinator, which adds to their credibility. Being part of Y Combinator's Batch W24 further endorses their innovative approach to a growing market.

**Future Directions**  
With EV adoption surging—73% of drivers want charging facilities in their residences—Starlight Charging actually encourages property owners to embrace EV charging as a value-adding amenity. They offer flexible ownership options like “You Pay, You Own” and “Lease to Own” models, ensuring that property managers can opt for solutions that best suit their financial strategies.

The company’s mission is to create an “agent workspace” where AI assistants can perform complex tasks collaboratively and autonomously—much like human employees, without being limited by conventional AI capabilities.

The founders recognized a gap in existing AI tools, which typically handle only simple, repetitive tasks. Superagent seeks to change that by allowing teams to employ AI agents that can engage in ongoing work—such as compliance, market research, and managing research and development. This means that businesses can streamline operations and tackle significant projects without the need to expand their human teams.

With only a small team of two, Superagent has the ambition to redefine the interaction between humans and AI in the workplace. Their platform is designed to not just improve efficiency but to act as a collaborative partner in achieving complex goals.

You can learn more about them through their website ([superagent.sh](https://superagent.sh/)), where they offer insights into their philosophy and updates on their technology. They also invite interested users to join their waitlist to be part of this cutting-edge workspace.

They don't just need a remittance app. They need a bank.

Founded in 2023 and incubated as part of Y Combinator Batch W24, this San Francisco-based company initially started out under the name Numo. The mission? To serve the global banking needs of a new generation of highly ambitious digital workers from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and beyond.

What’s interesting about this demographic is that they often rank in the 95th percentile of earners in their home countries yet grapple with a convoluted financial infrastructure. Their earnings are typically spread across various platforms like PEOs and gig marketplaces, and they face the instability of local currencies, which unfortunately are often depreciating against the US dollar. In short, while they’re doing well financially, the conventional banking options available to them are not cutting it—they need more than just a remittance app; they need a solid banking solution.

That’s where The New Money Company steps in. They offer international contractors US bank accounts, along with swift and low-cost payment systems, allowing users to control how and when their funds are repatriated. The result? Contractors can hold their income in USD right up until the moment they need it, giving them greater flexibility and security.

Their offerings include a suite of services such as the Metal Suite for trade funding and seamless transactions, MoneyGun for expedited payments, and Emerald for optimizing currency exchanges. With a small but focused team of just four employees led by Group Partner Brad Flora, the company is clearly geared towards tackling the unique challenges faced by contractors in emerging markets. 

Key tags associated with the company reflect their core focus areas: fintech, payments, compliance, emerging markets, and neobanking. They aim to empower their users and facilitate borderless financial interactions.

In essence, The New Money Company is more than just a fintech venture; it's a catalyst for economic opportunity, striving to rewrite the narrative for freelancers and international contractors navigating a fragmented financial landscape.

Founded in 2023 and situated in the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area, Velorum Therapeutics is making waves as a groundbreaking biotech company. Its mission? To develop powerful cancer drugs that literally starve tumors by tapping into the intricacies of cancer metabolism. This approach represents a fresh perspective in oncology, aiming to disrupt the status quo in cancer treatment.

As a member of the Y Combinator W24 cohort, Velorum is backed by one of the most prestigious accelerator programs in the world, which adds a layer of credibility to its innovative endeavors. The company currently operates with a lean team of three passionate employees, focusing on bringing cutting-edge cancer therapies to the forefront of medical science.

At the heart of Velorum’s strategy is a keen emphasis on heme biology. The company recognizes that heme—a crucial iron-containing molecule—plays a fundamental role in vital biological processes such as oxygen transport and energy generation. Unfortunately, this essential molecule has been overlooked in traditional drug development. Velorum aims to change that.

Cancer, as we've learned, often exploits bodily resources to fuel its growth, and heme is no exception. By understanding and manipulating how tumors consume heme, Velorum is on the path to developing therapies that can starve these malignant cells. Their pipeline of innovative treatments is tailored towards patients with urgent medical needs, potentially offering new options where few exist.

The company is headquartered in San Francisco and is a proud participant of the Y Combinator Batch W24. With a small, dedicated team of just three employees, Verse Therapy is currently operating in ten states and has onboarded over 35 therapists.

### The Vision

At its core, Verse Therapy seeks to make quality speech therapy accessible to everyone. They empower SLPs to establish and grow their practices, allowing them to focus on what they do best: providing compassionate and personalized care. By taking care of the often-overwhelming administrative tasks—think scheduling, insurance processing, and documentation—Verse Therapy significantly reduces the burnout that many therapists experience.

### How It Works

The platform features an AI-enabled back office that streamlines the business side of therapy. This innovation not only facilitates insurance processing and scheduling, but also enhances documentation practices, enabling therapists to prioritize client interaction. For clients, the process is straightforward: you can expect to start therapy in a matter of days instead of months. 

### Affordable and Convenient

Verse Therapy is making strides in reducing the costs associated with speech therapy. Clients typically pay less than half the cost of traditional therapies, as they work with a wide array of insurance providers. Furthermore, they offer self-pay options starting at just $95 per session.

### Services Offered

Verse Therapy caters to a broad range of speech-related issues, including:
- Speech sound disorders
- Voice disorders
- Fluency disorders
- Cognitive-communication therapy (essential for those recovering from strokes and brain injuries)
- Gender-affirming voice therapy
- Public speaking and professional communication strategies

Whether for children or adults, the platform's therapists are equipped to manage various communication challenges. 

### Client-Centric Approach

One of the standout features of Verse Therapy is its commitment to ongoing support. Therapists are accessible outside of scheduled sessions, allowing clients to reach out for additional help when they need it most. This level of accessibility and flexibility is a notable differentiator in the therapy space. 

### Conclusion

Yoneda Labs, founded in 2023 and part of the Y Combinator Batch W24, is a dynamic startup on a mission to transform chemical manufacturing through a foundation model designed specifically for this space. It emerged from the experience of its co-founder Jan, who, while working in chemical labs, encountered the frustrating reality of spending weeks trying to determine optimal reaction conditions for drug and material synthesis. This common struggle led him and his friends from the University of Cambridge to leverage machine learning in a bid to streamline and enhance the process.

The crux of what Yoneda Labs does is providing software that allows chemists to optimize reactions efficiently. Their models are aimed at simplifying the complex task of figuring out the best reaction parameters—like temperature, concentration, and catalysts—allowing chemists to focus more on innovation rather than trial and error.

**Why Yoneda Labs Matters**

In many industries, including pharmaceuticals and chemical manufacturing, the existing machine learning models haven't lived up to their promise—they generalize poorly and often require extensive programming skills. Yoneda tackles this head-on by creating user-friendly models that chemists can access directly in the lab. This accessibility is a game changer. Their technology not only speeds up the process but also helps companies test more drugs and improve their manufacturing processes, leading to cost reductions and lower environmental impacts.

**The Team and Backing**

With a compact team of just three talented employees, Yoneda Labs combines expertise in Computer Science, Machine Learning, and Chemistry. Their work is backed by reputable firms, including Y Combinator and Khosla Ventures, highlighting the confidence investors have in their vision.

**Key Features Offered by Yoneda Labs**

1. **Predict**: Enhances the ability to predict reliable conditions for novel reactions, accelerating the nomination of lead compounds significantly.
2. **Optimize**: Provides insights that can save millions on large-scale projects, pinpointing optimal process conditions much faster.

Zaymo is on a mission to transform the way ecommerce brands communicate with their customers through email. Founded in 2023 and a member of Y Combinator's W24 batch, Zaymo is pioneering an interactive email builder that allows Shopify merchants to create engaging, website-like communications directly in their email. This means the days of static, uninviting emails are numbered.

The brainchild of a team of three, Zaymo recognizes that recent technological advancements in email clients mean you can embed an entire website within an email. This innovation reduces friction for users and enhances conversion rates, making it an appealing solution for product marketing and data collection. 

Their capabilities extend to several interactive widgets that facilitate upsells, customer reviews, SMS sign-ups, surveys, and more—all without having customers leave their inbox. For example, Zaymo enables merchants to capture more reviews by embedding forms directly into post-purchase emails. One case study revealed that using Zaymo led to a **42% increase in captured reviews** and a **27% recovery rate of abandoned carts**.

The company remains focused on enhancing customer interaction. They emphasize that ""interactivity converts"" and leverage no-code solutions, allowing users with little technical expertise to build eye-catching emails that drive conversions. 

To summarize, Zaymo is reshaping email marketing for ecommerce by infusing interactivity into email campaigns, strengthening engagement, and ultimately boosting sales.
