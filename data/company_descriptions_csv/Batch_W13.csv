Founded out of Y Combinator's W13 batch, Watsi operates from San Francisco with a lean team of just 11 dedicated individuals. Their mission is simple yet powerful: to leverage technology to provide universal healthcare funding through direct costs for surgeries and primary care.

The way Watsi works is straightforward: anyone can fund a patient’s healthcare needs, with 100% of donations going directly to the surgeries. This approach not only helps patients get the care they need but also allows donors to see the real impact of their contributions. You can choose to make a one-time donation, start a monthly subscription to consistently support new patients, or even launch your own fundraising campaign.

One striking aspect of Watsi is the transparency it offers; donors receive updates after the treatments, meaning that you can witness firsthand the difference your support makes in someone's life. Patients like Valentine from Kenya, who suffered a motorcycle accident and needs surgery to repair her leg, rely on this platform. Her story is one of many; Watsi has successfully funded over 30,000 surgeries through their community of more than 31,000 donors.

By emphasizing grassroots funding, Watsi is redefining how we think about healthcare access in underserved regions worldwide. They believe that everyone, regardless of background or location, deserves access to medical care. If you want to be part of this change, you can visit them at [Watsi.org](https://watsi.org).

In summary, Watsi is not just a crowdfunding site; it’s a lifeline for many people facing medical crises.
