Automotive - With the widespread adoption of ADAS systems in new vehicles, the cost of replacing a windshield in new vehicles has tripled to $1500+. We have developed a windshield protection film product line called ExoShield to help vehicle owners protect their windshields. Our ExoShield GT3 film is sold through 400+ aftermarket installers and car dealerships in 56 countries that carry and install it for vehicle owners. For Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco owners (google: broken windshield club), our ExoShield ULTRA DIY kits are available via our website and dropshipping partners. 

Defense - Over the last 3 years, we have been working with the Canadian Armed Forces to develop an infrared camouflage technology. We have received two contracts from CAF to develop our technology. Our solution has the ability to be integrated into the uniform directly (adding just 5-10g of weight vs. 600-18,000 kg of weight for other alternatives), has outperformed all existing NATO alternatives in multiple CAF field trials, and is receiving support from major elements of CAF for our next contract.

### Mission and Products
Alchemy’s mission is clear: to harness the power of nanotechnology to create coatings that not only perform exceptionally but also protect crucial systems in vehicles and military applications.

**In the Automotive Sector:**
As vehicles incorporate more Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), the costs associated with repairs—like replacing a windshield—have surged significantly. Alchemy addresses this issue with their ExoShield product line, especially the ExoShield GT3 film, which has gained traction in over 400 aftermarket installers and dealerships across 56 countries. For those taking matters into their own hands, Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco enthusiasts can purchase ExoShield ULTRA DIY kits directly from their website.

**In the Defense Sector:**
Alchemy is making waves by developing cutting-edge infrared camouflage technology in collaboration with the Canadian Armed Forces. They’ve been awarded contracts to enhance military uniforms, adding minimal weight while outperforming existing NATO solutions during field trials. This technology can also be adapted for various applications, including face paint and vehicle camouflage.

### Innovative Approach
Alchemy distinguishes itself with a vertically integrated model. Their coatings are engineered with specific end applications in mind, ensuring optimal performance throughout their development cycle. This includes cutting-edge science that not only delivers high-functioning products but also keeps users—whether civilians or soldiers—safer.

### Looking Ahead

Traveling? Earn some extra cash.
Let backpack help you save that high shipping cost or earn a little extra.

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.
Whether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps. We would like to reject the counterfeits, we would like to reject the almost-originals, most importantly, we would like to not pay the heavy expense incurred, most of which we deem to be superfluous.

Backpack is a fresh concept in the realm of e-commerce, designed to connect shoppers and travelers globally. Founded during the Y Combinator Batch S14 and based out of San Francisco, Backpack embarks on a mission to make international shopping more accessible and cost-effective.

If you've ever found yourself longing for a product available overseas but deterred by steep shipping costs, here's where Backpack comes in as a game changer. The platform facilitates a peer-to-peer marketplace where travelers earn by carrying items from one locale to another. It transforms the age-old notion of shipping into a community-driven model.

### How It Works

For **travelers**: You share your travel itinerary, indicate what items you'd be willing to carry, wait for a shopper's request, negotiate the price, and deliver the goods—all while earning some extra cash along the way.

For **shoppers**: You browse your favorite sites, submit item requests by filling out details, and then find a traveler headed your way. It’s a straightforward process designed to make cross-border shopping not just possible, but efficient. With just a few clicks, you save on shipping and gain access to products that might be scarce or overpriced in your own country.

### The Goals

Backpack aspires to empower everyone across the globe by giving them the choice to buy authentic and affordable products without the hassle of counterfeit goods and exorbitant shipping fees. It caters to diverse markets—from unique electronics to rare pashminas and even specialized medications—ensuring that everyone has a fair shot at the best the world has to offer.

- **For Retailers:** They can reduce excess inventory and broaden their customer base, making the platform attractive for both parties.

### Categories of Products

### Consumer Engagement

Greentoe's platform not only allows for price negotiation but also emphasizes user engagement through features like “Greentoe Now,” which notifies users of real-time deals and discounts. This period of dynamic pricing adds to the allure, creating an engaging shopping experience where users feel in control.

### How It Works

For those curious about the mechanics of Greentoe, the process is straightforward:
1. **Browse Products:** Users explore different categories and select their desired items.
2. **Set Your Price:** The user proposes a price they are willing to pay.
3. **Offer Acceptance:** If a retailer accepts the offer, the user is notified and can complete the purchase.

### Mission Statement

Greentoe continually strives to empower consumers within the e-commerce landscape by offering transparency in pricing and value. They've built a marketplace that's not just about selling but about community and collaboration, often described as a refreshing shake-up in retail paradigms.

2. **Data Collaboration**: Promoting a collaborative approach to data, allowing for richer engagement without compromising user information.
3. **Revenue Generation**: Focused on maximizing direct revenue for publishers and optimizing media spend for advertisers.

**Why It Matters**
Permutive’s approach is critical in today’s ad-space landscape, which faces increasing scrutiny around data privacy and security. By innovating the infrastructure needed for ethical advertising, they not only safeguard consumer data but also enable brands to reconnect with their audiences in meaningful ways.

Whenever your customers change their jobs, UserGems automatically surfaces them as new leads to your sales reps directly in Salesforce. This enables reps to close more deals, faster.

Leveraging machine learning, UserGems automatically identifies other prospects that match your best customers. That means you get a complete, up-to-date list of leads that match your ICP, persona and other key criteria so that reps spend less time sourcing leads, and more time selling.",2015.0,[],"UserGems is a pioneering sales technology company founded in 2015, initially hailing from the esteemed Y Combinator Batch S14. Their mission is straightforward yet powerful: to empower sales teams with an AI-driven prospecting solution that is grounded in the behaviors and traits of their best customers. The company is based in Austria and boasts a skilled team of 60 employees.

At UserGems, the game-changing feature is the way they leverage AI to enhance lead generation in an incredibly efficient manner. Whenever a customer transitions to a new job, UserGems automatically flags this change as a new lead within Salesforce, allowing sales reps to optimize their outreach and close deals more quickly. This kind of responsiveness is crucial in today’s fast-paced sales environment.

UserGems employs machine learning to identify and surface prospects that closely resemble their most successful customers. This enables companies to build a comprehensive list of leads that fit their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) without the usual grunt work of lead sourcing. The system frees up sales reps to focus on what really matters: selling.

Their flagship product, Gem-E, acts as an AI outbound agent, helping sales teams personalize communication by drafting emails, call scripts, and even LinkedIn messages based on real-time signals and historical CRM data. This results in outreach that feels personal and relevant, significantly increasing the probability of conversions.

The company has rightly positioned itself within the B2B sales arena, offering benefits that include a measurable ROI—many of their clients have reported substantial increases in their pipelines and deal sizes since integrating UserGems into their workflows.

Michael Siebel, a prominent figure in the startup ecosystem, serves as their Group Partner, adding to the credibility of their innovative approach. UserGems is tagged under sales technology and has attracted recognition for its exceptional data quality and ease of integration with existing sales tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Outreach.
