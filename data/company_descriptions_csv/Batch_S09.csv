Founded in 2009, Stripe is a global technology company rooted in the ethos of Y Combinator, where it first blossomed during the Summer batch of 2009. Headquartered in San Francisco, Stripe has grown into a formidable player in the fintech arena, boasting a workforce of about 7,000 employees. Its mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to create economic infrastructure for the internet, enabling businesses, from fledgling startups to established public companies, to accept payments and manage their operations online efficiently.

### What Does Stripe Do?

At its core, Stripe is all about simplifying payments and financial interactions. It offers a robust suite of products tailored to meet the diverse needs of its users. This includes:

- **Global Payments**: From standard online payments to in-person transactions, Stripe empowers businesses to handle their payment processing smoothly. Key offerings under this umbrella include Payment Links for no-code setups, Checkout for pre-built payment forms, and Elements for customizable UI components.

- **Embedded Finance**: The Connect product allows platforms to incorporate payments, catering to marketplaces and multi-party transactions seamlessly.

- **Revenue and Finance Automation**: With solutions like Billing for subscription management, Revenue Recognition for accounting automation, and Tax tools for sales tax and VAT automation, Stripe helps companies streamline their financial operations.

- **Developer-Centric Tools**: Stripe provides powerful APIs and developer-friendly resources, enabling engineers to integrate payment solutions effortlessly. Additionally, Stripe's App Marketplace allows for connections with popular platforms such as Salesforce and Xero.

### Why Stripe Stands Out

Stripe’s unique approach lies in its commitment to use technology as a lever for economic growth. By partnering with a myriad of companies (from Airbnb to startups like Defog), Stripe has successfully become an engine for scaling businesses and enhancing the overall GDP of the internet.

Their emphasis on no-code solutions caters to those without extensive technical skills, making Stripe accessible to a broader audience. Their platform supports over 135 currencies and payment methods, showcasing their global reach and adaptability in various markets.

### A Legacy of Growth

Stripe's impact on the business world is vast. With API requests that surpass 500 million daily and a historical uptime of over 99.999%, businesses worldwide have come to rely on Stripe not just as a payment processor, but as a foundational layer for its financial infrastructure. The company’s focus on stability and reliability has made it a trusted partner in the journey of many businesses.

The future looks bright for Stripe as it continues to innovate within the fintech space, redefining what it means to manage economic operations in a digital-first world. For anyone looking to equip their business with the tools to thrive online, Stripe is a go-to choice.
