We serve the 68M people in the US (mainly Women and POC) who are denied credit due to historical bias and the lack of access that current banks provide to credit building and tools. (It wasn't until The Equal Credit Opportunity Act in the 1970's that Women and ""Minorities"" could even get fair access to credit)!

Altro has created a mobile that allows anyone to have access to credit, using their subscriptions as a means to start building their credit score. Altro lends to members a $75 Line of Credit to pay for their subscriptions, such as Netflix, Hulu, HelloFresh, etc. This card is built to solely work on the subscriptions that the member is already paying for, allowing them to securely use their $75 credit to build their credit using things they are already paying for.

Doing this empowers folx who were denied credit a way to start building their score and financial power. Altro will service millions of people in not only building their credit, but also gaining access to the tools (such as personal loans, emergency funds, car/house loans and more) that they could not access prior.",2019.0,"[{'name': 'Michael Broughton, Founder', 'description': 'College dropout & founder of Perch.', 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-j-broughton/'}]","Altro is a fintech startup on a mission to “Build Credit With Your Subscriptions.” Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S20, this Los Angeles-based company is tackling one of the most significant issues in the credit industry: access. 

With 68 million people in the U.S. struggling to gain fair credit access—many of whom are women and people of color—Altro aims to bridge that gap. Historically, credit opportunities have been limited by bias, a legacy that continues. It wasn't until the 1970s, with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, that these groups even began to see fair treatment. 

Altro’s innovative platform allows members to leverage everyday subscriptions—think services like Netflix, Hulu, and HelloFresh—as a means of building their credit scores. By providing a $75 line of credit that’s exclusively used for these subscriptions, Altro enables users to turn their monthly expenses into a tool for credit-building. This means that customers can start to establish a credit history without jumping through traditional financial hurdles.

The app isn’t just about the quick fix; it’s about empowerment. By using Altro, members not only work toward a better credit score but also gain access to traditional financial tools like personal loans and mortgages that were previously inaccessible. It's a fresh approach in an industry dominated by outdated practices.

**Overview:**
Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator's summer batch, Atmos is a San Francisco-based startup that’s tackling a big challenge in the housing market: making the custom homebuilding process completely online.

- **Lot assessments**: Experts evaluate the specific characteristics of chosen land.
- **Custom floor plan design**: Every home is tailored to the unique needs and preferences of its future occupants.

Atmos places great emphasis on client involvement and satisfaction. Prospective homeowners can visualize their designs through 3D walkthroughs before construction begins, making the process highly interactive and personalized. The firm's approach ensures that each home reflects the distinct needs of its owners, turning houses into tailored, personal spaces.

**Financial Model:**

This streamlined approach not only saves time but also enhances the overall experience for clients, who have a single point of contact throughout their journey.

Atmos is headquartered in the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area, a fitting locale for such an innovative approach to homebuilding. Their relatively small team allows for agility and close collaboration, whether it’s with builders or clients.

Founded in 2019 and part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2020 batch, Blissway is a Denver-based company that’s redefining the tolling industry. With a lean team of 18, it's on a mission to establish the tolling industry's prime tech infrastructure.

Toll collection, as it stands today, primarily relies on cumbersome gantries and transponders—an outdated model that raises costs and driver inconvenience. Blissway is flipping this script. Instead of relying on traditional overhead structures, they’ve introduced the Wireless Autonomous Lane Enforcer (WAL-E), a smart solution that enables more efficient and reliable tolling processes right from the roadside.

The WAL-E devices, paired with powerful cloud-based analytics, promise to identify and track every vehicle with performance metrics that meet or exceed existing systems. This innovation applies to various tolling applications, including multi-lane and vehicle classification, express lane management, and disaster recovery, creating a modernized and user-friendly tolling experience.

CarbonChain is a UK-based tech company founded in 2020, nestled in the heart of London and proudly part of Y Combinator’s Batch S20. Their mission is straightforward yet vital: to help companies automate the accounting of their carbon emissions, particularly those in industries that have a significant environmental footprint.

Initially, CarbonChain carved out a niche by developing a Software as a Service (SaaS) tool that enables businesses—especially those operating within highly polluting sectors—to track their supply chain carbon emissions. This not only helps these companies mitigate risks but also prepares them for looming carbon taxes and regulatory penalties that are becoming more prevalent worldwide. 

The CarbonChain team currently consists of 16 passionate individuals, spearheaded by Group Partner Gustaf Alstromer. Their work is pivotal for industries facing increasing scrutiny regarding their carbon footprints, particularly as consumers and regulators alike push for transparency and accountability. 

### What They Offer

The platform provides three core functionalities:

1. **Measure**: Users can confidently track and quantify their emissions.
2. **Report**: Businesses can generate reports quickly and efficiently, easing the burden of compliance.
3. **Transition**: The tool assists in setting targets, ultimately guiding companies on their journey to a sustainable future.

### Market Focus

Their services cater specifically to manufacturers, commodity traders, and banks, making it clear that their technology is tailored for industries with complex supply chains that need precise emissions tracking. By offering a solution that can manage up to 80% of global emissions coverage across more than 135,000 tracked assets, CarbonChain sets itself apart by catering to the unique challenges these sectors face.

### Why It Matters

Not only does CarbonChain's solution help businesses reduce risks associated with carbon regulations, but it also empowers them to lead in the low-carbon economy.

**Mission Statement:**  
Dripos aims to be the only software any coffee shop will need to operate efficiently. 

Imagine running a café where everything is streamlined under one roof. That's what Dripos is all about.

#### What Makes Dripos Stand Out?

**One Integrated System:**  
Dripos isn't just a POS. While traditional systems separate functions and create the need for cumbersome integrations, Dripos pulls everything into one intuitive app. This means no more juggling multiple software solutions that don’t talk to each other—everything from team management to marketing is housed in a single place.

**Empowering Coffee Shops:**  
The team behind Dripos consulted directly with café operators to build the ideal POS solution. They learned what features were missing from existing market players like Square, Clover, and Toast, and set out to create a solution that meets all the needs of today’s coffee shops in real time.

**Customer-Centric Features:**  
From offering mobile ordering to managing crew schedules, Dripos allows cafes to accept orders through various channels (in-store, mobile app, website, kiosks, and delivery) while ensuring everything syncs back to a centralized menu. This efficiency translates to fewer errors and happier customers. 

**Innovative Management Tools:**  
The software comes packed with detailed analytics, automated inventory management, payroll capabilities, and customizable reporting. It’s basically an entire management team right in your pocket! 

#### Why Cafés Love Dripos

Testimonials from satisfied clients like Carlos Falcon of Grace Coffee Co and Sara Volkmann of Cafe Diem highlight how transitioning to Dripos has dramatically improved their operations. These café owners have experienced firsthand how Dripos eliminates headaches and allows them to focus on what they do best—serving coffee.

Founded in 2020, this Bengaluru-based startup is tackling a critical pain point in the restaurant industry: the lack of an integrated, cloud-based management system. Traditionally, restaurant owners have faced the frustration of juggling multiple, disjointed software systems that simply don’t communicate with each other. Explorex aims to change that.

The company delivers a comprehensive, full-stack solution tailored for the over 30 million restaurants in India. Their platform covers everything from order management and operations to online delivery, payment processing, and guest engagement. By consolidating all these features into a singular system, Explorex eliminates the inefficiencies of using several unconnected services.

Explorex gained traction quickly, emerging from Y Combinator’s S20 batch, which provided valuable guidance and resources for scaling its services. The team, composed of 18 employees, has received endorsements from restaurant owners like Fox in the Field and Food Culture, who praise the platform for boosting operational efficiency and revenue. 

So, what sets Explorex apart? Here are the core features:

1. **Automated Ordering**: Customers can place orders directly through a web app—no cumbersome app downloads required.
2. **Integrated POS**: A cloud-based point of sale that facilitates seamless order tracking and management.
3. **Real-Time Analytics**: Owners have access to live data on restaurant performance, enabling data-driven decisions.
4. **Customer Re-engagement Tools**: Smart profiling helps restaurants connect with their customers, enhancing loyalty and retention through targeted campaigns.
5. **Third-Party Delivery Integration**: Manage multiple delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato from a single dashboard.

Glimpse, founded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's S20 batch, is based in New York and operates with a lean team of three. The company has effectively carved out a niche by leveraging artificial intelligence to help retail-first consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands manage their finances more efficiently. 

**Mission & Services**

The primary mission of Glimpse is straightforward: to automate tedious cash reconciliation processes for brands that sell in retail. Let's break that down. Picture a beverage company that sells $100k worth of product to Whole Foods but only receives a meager $60k due to a slew of unexplained deductions. These deductions can be buried within mountains of paperwork, often making it hard to ascertain their validity. 

Glimpse steps in here, automating the entire deduction management process. By using AI to analyze and dispute these deductions, Glimpse helps brands reclaim invalid fees efficiently—recovering 2-3% of their top-line sales and saving dozens of hours of backbreaking manual work each week. 

**Key Features and Functionality**

1. **Automated Categorization:** The platform swiftly imports and categorizes deductions in real-time, allowing brands to regain precious hours of their time.
   
2. **AI Dispute Engine:** Your in-house deductions expert can automatically identify invalid deductions, file disputes, and ensure follow-ups until any unjustified claims are resolved.

3. **Integrated Reconciliation:** Glimpse streamlines the reconciliation of credit memos with integrations to popular accounting software like QuickBooks and NetSuite.

Glimpse operates on a success-based pricing model—essentially, they only make money when their clients do. This risk-free approach involves a low monthly fee coupled with a commission on recovered funds from successful disputes.

**Current Focus and Growth Potential**

While they currently excel in handling deductions from suppliers like KeHE and UNFI, they're in the process of expanding to include other major retailers like CVS and Target. This keen focus allows for maximum efficiency and quality control, addressing vital pain points for brands eager to reclaim their money without drowning in paperwork.

Overall, Glimpse isn’t just a tool; it’s a formidable partner in the retail finance landscape, backed by key players like Gustaf Alstromer, a Group Partner at Y Combinator.

This small but ambitious company, part of Y Combinator's Summer 2020 batch, is on a clear mission: to make fast food even faster. They tackle a significant pain point in the industry—wait times.

The core idea is straightforward: speed of service is what defines fast food. Yet, owners often lack solid methods to measure and improve it. Hellometer steps in with a solution that harnesses the power of security cameras. By analyzing footage, they pinpoint when and where slowdowns happen in the service process. They have found that every 7 seconds shaved off wait times translates to a 1% increase in revenues. For some fast food chains, that could mean a whopping $30,000 boost annually.

Their offerings include innovative tools such as the Drive-Thru Timer and Dining Room Timer. These tools allow restaurants to gauge guest experiences accurately—from the moment they arrive to when they receive their food. With cutting-edge AI and computer vision technology, Hellometer not only helps in improving efficiency but also enhances customer satisfaction.

The team may be small—only 2 employees—but they have a clear focus and a well-defined market. They tap into the burgeoning B2B SaaS and computer vision sectors, making their mark by providing a service that is surprisingly easy to implement. Just put up a camera, and the data starts flowing.

### What They Do

At the heart of inSoma Bio's offerings is their unique **Fractomer Biomatrix**, a bio-inspired product designed to enhance reconstructive plastic surgery.

- **Tissue Support**: These products provide necessary support and shape for co-injected cells or tissues, promoting biointegration.
- **Thermal Activation**: A built-in thermal switch activates their materials only at body temperature, enhancing safety and efficacy.
- **Recombinant Production**: Created at the genetic level, allowing for production without the need to harvest natural tissues.

### The Team

The team behind inSoma Bio is led by Dr. **Stefan Roberts**, who brings nearly a decade of experience in biomaterials design, which he developed as part of his dissertation at Duke University. He is joined by noted figures such as Dr. **Ashutosh Chilkoti**, a seasoned founder and chair of the Biomedical Engineering Department at Duke, and Dr. **Scott Hollenbeck**, a leading plastic surgeon at the University of Virginia who shapes the company's medical advisory direction.

Founded in 2020 as part of Y Combinator's Summer 2020 batch, Jitsu is a San Francisco-based company that specializes in the seamless collection of event data across various platforms—be it web browsers, applications, emails, or chatbots. Its mission? To capture event data into your data stack. And the way it's doing this? Fast, open-source, and incredibly durable.

**What Makes Jitsu Stand Out?**

- **Open Source**: 100% open-source and designed for flexibility, Jitsu can be deployed on your own infrastructure or it can run in the cloud, with no strings attached. This setup resonates well with developers who favor autonomy and customization.
  
- **Rapid Implementation**: Setting up Jitsu is refreshingly simple. You just add a tag to your source, similar to Google Analytics. In just minutes, you can start collecting data with minimal hassle. 

- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Jitsu emphasizes a ""warehouse-first"" strategy, allowing users to maintain their data warehouses as single sources of truth without getting tangled up with vendor restrictions.

- **Real-Time Streaming**: It boasts real-time event streaming capabilities, meaning your user behavior data flows directly into your preferred data warehouse, ready for analysis within minutes instead of hours.

- **Developer Flexibility**: Jitsu Functions allow developers to modify and filter events in real-time using a familiar JavaScript environment, tapping into the rich ecosystem of npm packages and libraries.

**Key Features**

1. **Event Capture**: A straightforward tagging mechanism to capture events from any platform.
   
2. **Data Privacy**: Users can utilize their data warehouses (like Snowflake or BigQuery) while also having free access to Clickhouse.

3. **Automatic User Identity**: Jitsu builds a real-time identity graph, aggregating user data seamlessly—no complex SQL queries needed.

4. **Custom Domains**: To combat ad-blockers and to maintain clean analytics, Jitsu can operate under your own subdomain.

**Customer Support and Pricing**

Jitsu offers a generous free tier for businesses, allowing up to 200,000 events without requiring a credit card. Trusted by industry leaders like PandaDoc and Investing.com, Jitsu is demonstrably effective for organizations looking to enhance their data handling capabilities.

Well, they’re not just any microbes—they’re novel microbial cultures that help food manufacturers craft innovative edible creations.

Their offerings include the world’s first 0-calorie fermented sodas, unique beers bursting with new flavors, and plant-based dairy alternatives. Kingdom Supercultures specializes in what they call Superculture® ingredients—an exciting new class of ingredients designed to harness natural microbes. This range is especially aimed at enhancing the food experience for companion animals, delivering functional benefits through live cultures or fermentates.

Now, how does all this out-of-the-box innovation come to life? It starts with isolating tens of thousands of unique natural strains from food. With advanced automation and analytical techniques, they reassemble these microbes into Superculture blends that pack functionalities unlike anything currently available on the market. This means businesses can create next-gen products, such as lower-alcohol but full-flavor wines and yogurts that mimic the creaminess of dairy.

So far, they’ve made impressive strides, raising $25 million in Series A funding to expand their suite of non-GMO microbes and partnering with high-profile eateries like Eleven Madison Park for their plant-based menu. With a small but dedicated team of eight, including Group Partner Michael Seibel from Y Combinator, Kingdom Supercultures is set up for significant growth in an ever-evolving food landscape.

Here’s how it works: when employees receive a cash advance to cover their living costs, they can start contributing to their 401(k) matches. Once those contributions vest, Lendtable takes a portion of the match as payment for the advance. This creates a win-win scenario—employees get the financial boost they need, and Lendtable profits only when the employees succeed. 

With a solid backing from Y Combinator and an innovative approach to financial wellness, Lendtable is redefining how employees think about and access their retirement benefits. Check them out at [lendtable.com](http://lendtable.com).

#### Mission
Mobius Materials aims to create a safe and efficient spot market for semiconductors and electronic components, helping manufacturers buy and sell chips quickly and at market prices. The intent is to streamline the often cumbersome process of hardware sourcing and minimize the financial waste that comes from excess inventory.

- Access a range of verified parts from reputable manufacturers, with significant savings up to 70%
- Source rare components, particularly useful during shortages

Their platform also addresses the common challenges manufacturers face: sourcing too few parts can lead to rushed re-orders, while over-sourcing can result in substantial financial loss. By connecting buyers with sellers of excess inventory, Mobius alleviates the risks associated with both underbuying and overbuying.

#### Industry Focus

- **Group Partner:** Gustaf Alstromer, a notable figure in the startup ecosystem.

#### Unique Selling Proposition
Mobius stands out by ensuring that all components are sourced from vetted suppliers, with every part authenticated and tested. This rigorous approach fosters trust and reliability, a critical need in an industry riddled with counterfeiting risks and supply chain uncertainties.

### Notable Testimonials
Mobius has received positive feedback, with partners highlighting its effectiveness in reducing costs and excess inventory. Some have noted substantial cost savings—around 25%—from swapping out ill-fitting components on their bills of materials (BOM).

### Conclusion

**Mission:**  
Mozper exists to modernize how families in Latin America manage pocket money and education around finances. By offering a debit card and a companion app, Mozper enables parents to teach their children financial responsibility in a safe and controlled manner.

---

**The Problem:**  
In a region where about 70% of the population lacks formal financial education, the traditional means of giving pocket money—whether in cash or using parents' debit/credit cards—just isn’t cutting it. Brazilian and Mexican parents alone allocate over $10 billion annually to their children as allowances. Yet, how do parents give money without risking overindulgence on things like video games?

---

**The Solution:**  
Enter Mozper’s debit card and app, specifically designed for kids and teenagers:

- **Allowance Management:** Parents can automate weekly or monthly allowances directly to their kids’ Mozper accounts.
- **Spending Restrictions:** They can set specific spending rules to control how and where their children use their funds—be it online or in stores.
- **Chores and Rewards:** Parents can assign chores and provide financial rewards to foster a sense of achievement and responsibility regarding money.
- **Savings Goals:** Children are encouraged to save by setting financial goals that yield interest, turning every penny saved into a learning experience.

Currently, Mozper operates in Mexico, with plans for future expansions.

---

**Key Features:**
1. **Automatic Allowance:** Funds can be sent to kids automatically, helping them budget more effectively.
2. **Savings with Returns:** Children can earn funds on their savings, bringing the fun of money management to a new level.
3. **Task-Based Rewards:** By completing chores, kids can earn money, teaching them the value of work.
4. **Spending Categories:** Parents determine categories where their children can spend, ensuring they're instilled with financial discipline.
5. **Security Measures:** Cards are restricted from spending in age-inappropriate places (e.g., alcohol or tobacco).

In a digital era where many kids are already savvy with technology, Mozper empowers them with real-world financial skills while keeping parents in the loop.

---

**Conclusion:**  
With over 500,000 families using the service, Mozper isn't just another fintech product; it's a stepping stone toward creating financially responsible adults. The blend of education, technology, and parental supervision makes Mozper a compelling option for modern families navigating the complexities of finance in a digital age. The bottom line? Mozper is more than a card—it's a tool for teaching the importance of money management from a young age.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S20,,,"Osmind is the premier platform for clinicians and researchers advancing new life-saving mental health treatments. Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

Founded in 2020 and hailing from the vibrant San Leandro, California, Rarebird is upending the coffee game. Imagine waking up to a cup of coffee that doesn’t make you jittery, anxious, or disrupt your sleep. That’s the mission here: to elevate mental health and coffee culture hand-in-hand. With a nod to wellness enthusiasts, they're introducing Px coffee—a revolutionary caffeine replacement that claims to be better than caffeine itself.

Rarebird's story began with a simple realization: caffeine, while effective in boosting alertness, often comes with some undesired baggage. Enter paraxanthine (Px), the primary metabolite of caffeine that your body naturally produces. Rarebird has harnessed this concept to create a unique product that retains coffee's comforting ritual while cutting out the jitters.

With an expert-supported approach, they have meticulously developed this product, backed by the National Science Foundation. Their Px coffee is made from Colombian Arabica beans processed in a way that preserves flavors while being kinder to your body.

The team is small but mighty, consisting of just five dedicated employees. As part of Y Combinator's S20 batch, they've gained traction and visibility, drawing interest from various media like Forbes and Perfect Daily Grind. Their goal? To make Px coffee an integral part of your daily routine—right alongside your morning ritual.

Currently, Rarebird offers a range of options, including ground coffee and single-serve pods. The beauty of Px is that it promises to energize without the negative consequences typically associated with traditional caffeine. Brewed just like any regular coffee, it caters to both convenience lovers and those who enjoy a good pour-over.

The company is steadily building a brand that aligns itself with a growing preference for wellness-focused products.

**Company Overview:**
SiPhox Health, founded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's S20 batch, is making waves in the health-tech landscape from its base in Burlington, MA. With an innovative team of 30, led by Group Partner Jared Friedman, the company is harnessing silicon photonic technology to revolutionize at-home health monitoring.

**Mission:**
SiPhox is on a mission to democratize health monitoring. By replacing cumbersome lab equipment with compact silicon photonic chips, they enable users to monitor vital health markers right from their homes. This not only saves time but also reduces costs for consumers.

**Product and Services:**
The company offers a comprehensive at-home testing solution that provides insights into over 50 health markers, such as cardiovascular health, hormonal balances, and nutritional status. Users can choose from various testing programs tailored to specific health goals, including longevity, weight management, and metabolic health. 

Their approach to testing is as straightforward as it gets:
1. **Order a Kit:** Arrives at your doorstep.
2. **Collect Your Sample:** Simple instructions ensure accurate sampling.
3. **Receive Actionable Insights:** With results in days, users can adapt their lifestyle based on their health data.

**Why SiPhox Stands Out:**
SiPhox claims to have slashed the costs associated with blood testing by up to 80%. Traditional testing often requires multiple kits for a full panel; SiPhox consolidates this into a single kit, maximizing efficiency and accuracy. Their commitment to privacy includes HIPAA-grade security and a strict no-data-selling policy.

**Community and Feedback:**
With over 20,000 users already benefiting from SiPhox services, testimonials highlight life-saving results and the convenience of at-home testing. Their coaching sessions provide an added layer of personalized insight, enhancing user engagement with their health.

By catching performance defects early, Speedscale trims weeks of testing down to just a few days.

- **Local Development Environments**: Simulate API and database responses rapidly, eliminating delays caused by unreliable shared environments.

- **Legacy Software Migration**: Transition from old software with confidence, ensuring new implementations work as intended.

Their group partner, Gustaf Alstromer, adds value with experience, supporting their growth journey. The strategic focus on **developer tools**, **DevSecOps**, and **Kubernetes** positions Speedscale as a valuable player in the software development ecosystem.

TANGObuilder is revolutionizing the structural engineering process by automating what has traditionally been a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Founded in 2019 and hailing from the Y Combinator Batch S20, this San Francisco-based company is determined to streamline building design.

The problem they’re tackling is straightforward but critical: architects submit complex designs to structural engineers, who must then painstakingly draft the structural elements—walls, beams, columns—to ensure safety and compliance with regulations. This back-and-forth usually takes about 4 to 6 weeks, a significant bottleneck in the design process. TANGObuilder uses innovative technology to generate structural designs in real-time. This not only slashes the initial drafting time but also reduces material usage by 30%—a win-win for efficiency and sustainability.

With a small but capable team of nine, TANGObuilder is well-positioned to push the boundaries of how buildings are designed and constructed. Their impact on the construction and housing industry stands to be significant, especially as they continue to evolve their offerings.

Tella, founded in 2020 and part of the Y Combinator S20 batch, is revolutionizing the way we create videos. Based in Amsterdam, this lean team of six is on a mission: “The screen recorder that edits videos for you.” And they mean it.

#### What Is Tella?

At its core, Tella is a screen recording tool that takes the pain out of video creation. It combines the capabilities of traditional screen recorders with intuitive editing features—even automating the editing process with AI. Imagine recording product demos, tutorials, or any video effortlessly, without needing to fiddle around with complex editing software for hours. That’s the Tella promise. 

#### Features That Stand Out

- **Manageable Clips**: Record in bite-sized clips rather than long takes. This helps keep your content organized and easier to digest.
- **Speaker Notes**: Never lose track of what you want to say. Write your notes right in the app to stay focused.
- **Cross-Platform Capability**: Use it on both Mac and PC seamlessly, thanks to its browser-based options.
- **Effortless Editing**: With Tella, you can trim silences, remove filler words like ""um,"" and even edit the video as if it were a text document. The AI features mean you're not scrubbing through endless footage any longer—just cut to the good stuff with a click.
- **Dynamic Publishing Options**: Share your videos instantly online with customizable links or download them in 4K for that extra polish. 

#### Real Users, Real Impact

Entrepreneurs and creators alike are raving about Tella. Users have shared their experience switching from platforms like Loom, noting Tella's user-friendliness and professional output. One user noted that their content creation speed accelerated thanks to the platform, while another praised its customization options for product demos. 

#### Cost and Getting Started

Tella offers a **7-day free trial** with no credit card needed, making it easy to test it out. You’ll find it not just an investment in tools, but an investment in time saved and production quality.

## What They Do

At its core, Todos Comemos seeks to enhance lives by providing better access to pre-made food options. Here’s how they’re doing it:

1. **Cutting-Edge Solutions**: The company is developing advanced technologies specifically for the pre-made food sector in LATAM. This approach ensures that local producers can offer healthier meal options that appeal to a wider audience.

2. **Scaling Businesses**: Todos Comemos acts as a booster for established food brands, providing a one-stop distribution solution that allows them to scale rapidly—from reaching a handful of customers to thousands—through a multichannel sales strategy.

3. **Subscription Services**: They are building the region's first subscription service that offers a diverse range of pre-made and ready-to-eat meals, catering to varying dietary needs and preferences.

## Business Model

Todos Comemos describes itself as more than just a service provider—it's a growth partner. They utilize an open book model, which means they transparently charge producers for operational costs alongside a 10% fee for using their logistics ""highway."" 

Their platform integrates sales, logistics, and trade marketing, allowing food producers to streamline their operations and thrive in both traditional and new sales channels. This includes fast delivery services and a robust cold supply chain for perishable goods.

## Target Audience

By improving access to various sales channels—including convenience stores, pharmacies, and direct-to-consumer sales—they empower these producers to optimize their operations and maximize sales potential.

## Success Stories

Todos Comemos has already begun creating success stories, helping some businesses—like Franui—transition from zero sales to generating $150,000 a month within just two months. Their management team blends experience from the food tech and marketplace industries, with co-founders Santiago Espinosa and Mateo Cárdenas bringing their significant expertise to the table.

VenoStent, founded in 2017, is on a mission to tackle a critical problem in vascular surgeries. Every year, there are around 10 million dialysis and bypass operations globally, but up to 50% of these procedures fail. This startling statistic reveals the necessity for better support during such critical operations. Enter VenoStent's flagship product: the SelfWrap, a bioabsorbable vascular wrap designed to substantially reduce the failure rates of dialysis access points.

Based in Houston, Texas, VenoStent has a compact but effective team of 17 talented individuals. Their expertise spans biomedical and materials engineering, as well as medical 3D printing, which is central to their innovative technological approach.

### The Technology: SelfWrap

The SelfWrap is a flexible and bioabsorbable device specifically created to enhance the success rates of dialysis access sites. For patients with end-stage renal disease, these access points are not just clinical necessities; they're crucial lifelines. However, the reality is stark: 50-60% of these sites fail within the first year of use. In the U.S. alone, this translates into over 480,000 patients relying on hemodialysis and an eye-watering $4 billion in Medicare costs due to access site failures.

VenoStent aims to change this narrative by pioneering a novel tissue engineering technique, focusing initially on renal dialysis access. Their efforts haven't gone unnoticed; the SelfWrap recently received FDA's Breakthrough Device Designation, enabling expedited development and review processes for innovative technologies that could significantly improve patient outcomes.

### Recent Developments

VenoStent is making strides in its clinical research, having recently enrolled subjects for a pivotal clinical trial. They completed a $16 million Series A financing round, marking a significant milestone in their growth journey.

### The Team and Vision

Guided by the expertise of Jared Friedman, their Group Partner at Y Combinator, VenoStent embodies a forward-thinking attitude. Positioned as an innovative force within the medical device field, they aim not just to introduce a new product but to transform how vascular surgeries are approached, especially in the context of dialysis.

**Introduction**
Founded in 2020 and a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch S20, Webapp.io is revolutionizing the way teams build web applications. Based in Toronto, Canada, this lean team of four is dedicated to making CI/CD processes ten times faster, enhancing productivity through powerful preview environments and streamlined pipelines.

**Mission**
Webapp.io is on a mission to help development teams build web applications faster, simplifying what can often be a convoluted deployment process. Their early innovation—a custom hypervisor—makes Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), end-to-end testing, and preview environments as easy as creating a Dockerfile.

**Core Features**
1. **Preview Environments**: Access full-stack previews of applications with ease, allowing developers to see their changes live before merging to production.
2. **Enhanced CI/CD**: Fast and efficient pipelines eliminate waiting time with advanced caching strategies. This means no more delays waiting for dependencies to install.
3. **Parallel Testing**: Webapp.io allows for creating multiple copies of your app for rapid testing, significantly speeding up the feedback loop during development.

**Getting Started**
Setting up Webapp.io is refreshingly quick—you're just three steps away:
1. Integrate with your source control system (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. Define build processes with a Layerfile, akin to a Dockerfile.
3. Push your code, and let Webapp.io handle the rest.

**Integration and Compatibility**
Webapp.io seamlessly integrates with popular tools and frameworks including Docker, Cypress, and Jest. This compatibility ensures that developers can easily plug Webapp.io into their existing workflows.

**Why Developers Love Webapp.io**
The core of Webapp.io's appeal lies in its ability to eliminate bottlenecks in the development process. Developers rave about:
- **10x Faster Iteration**: Streamlined builds and tests save valuable time.
- **Ease of Use**: No complex systems—just straightforward integration and deployment.
- **Active Community Support**: The team and fellow users are eager to assist, making troubleshooting easier.

**Future & Outlook**
While the company has set its sights firmly on reshaping web application development now, they have announced a shutdown date of June 1, 2025. This creates an urgency to try out their offering and potentially shape future integrations or similar tools. 

Whether your team is building web apps or looking for better deployment solutions, Webapp.io is ready to help. Reach out for a trial and experience faster CI/CD flows.
