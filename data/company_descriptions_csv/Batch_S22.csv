,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S22,,,"ALT TEX is a Toronto-based biomaterials startup that has developed the world’s first biodegradable and carbon neutral fabric, engineered from the world’s largest landfill contributor - food waste. Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. 

The product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:

(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.

(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.

(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.

Co-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry.

**Overview:**  
Founded in 2020 and located in Toronto, ALT TEX is a forward-thinking biomaterials startup on a mission to revolutionize the fashion industry with biodegradable and carbon-neutral textiles made from food waste. They're not just another fabric manufacturer; they are addressing one of the biggest environmental challenges posed by the fashion sector's reliance on synthetic materials, particularly polyester, which accounts for a staggering 60% of the $2.5 trillion industry.

**The Problem:**  
Traditional polyester production is a major pollutant, consuming oil and contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. With sustainability mandates becoming a priority for brands, there is a pressing need for alternatives that don’t compromise on performance.

**The Solution:**  
ALT TEX is pioneering a unique fermentation technology that transforms food waste—a substantial landfill contributor—into a strong, cost-competitive polyester alternative. Their product offers three standout benefits:

1. **For Fashion Brands:** ALT TEX enables companies to adopt sustainable fabrics without overhauling their supply chains, tapping into the growing trend of sustainable fashion, which is skyrocketing at an 11% annual growth rate.
   
2. **For Consumers:** Their fabric is projected to be half the price of other sustainable options, dramatically increasing accessibility and encouraging broader adoption.

**Company Overview**
Aurelian, founded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator Batch S22, is a startup based in Seattle, WA, on a mission to automate non-emergency call management for 911 centers. With a small but dedicated team of six, Aurelian is leveraging cutting-edge technology to transform how public safety agencies operate.

**The Problem**
Did you know that upwards of 80% of calls that public safety agencies handle are administrative in nature? These can range from citizens inquiring about parking tickets to reporting non-urgent issues like a power outage. This deluge of non-emergency calls bogs down 911 dispatchers, preventing them from focusing on genuine emergencies that require immediate attention.

**The Solution**
Enter Aurelian's AI-powered voice operator—an intelligent system designed to instantly route, triage, and resolve these calls. By automating the preliminary steps of call handling, Aurelian allows dispatchers to spend their time on urgent matters. To date, they have facilitated the automation of hundreds of thousands of calls and ensured thousands of emergent calls reached the 911 lines without delay.

**How It Works**
Aurelian's technology includes several key features:
- **Call Routing:** Directs callers to the appropriate department while providing them with relevant online resources via text.
- **Emergency Triage:** Monitors calls in real-time to identify situations that may require immediate assistance.
- **Service Call Generation:** Collects detailed incident-specific information, helping create calls for service efficiently.

Aurelian's AI is multilingual, supporting Spanish, French, and 33 other languages, making it accessible to a broader population. Their system is customizable, which means it can adapt to the unique needs of different emergency communication centers (ECCs).

**Endorsements and Vision**
Testimonials from industry experts highlight Aurelian's necessity. Gerrit Klein, Technical Services Manager at MACC 911, emphasizes, “911 dispatchers should ONLY handle 911 calls.” The sentiment is echoed by D.T. Donaldson, Director at MACC 911, who notes the strong reliance on Aurelian's solutions.

This mindset reflects a profound belief: public safety agencies must evolve to thrive in modern times, or risk stagnation. Aurelian is positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution, with a powerful voice AI that not only routes calls but actively resolves caller needs, thereby optimizing service delivery.

**Current Endeavors**
Right now, Aurelian is not just talk. They are actively automating administrative calls for MACC 911, enhancing their functionality and efficiency. The company’s growth trajectory is promising as they continue to redefine the standards of public safety communication.

**Why It Matters**:  
The need for enhanced communication in an age where customer interactions have become largely digital cannot be overstated. With AviaryAI's solution, financial institutions can achieve:
- **Higher Engagement Rates**: Their voice agents provide a human touch, which can drive customer satisfaction.

Founded in 2022 and emerging from Y Combinator’s Batch S22, Avina is reshaping how B2B sales teams engage with prospects. Headquartered in New York and powered by a dedicated team of five, Avina aims to give sellers an unparalleled advantage with its innovative AI sales companion.

### Mission-Driven Approach

Avina’s mission succinctly puts it: ""X-Ray Vision for Your Sales Team."" In a rapidly evolving market post-pandemic, sales cycles are longer, teams face increased competition, and expectations have risen. Amidst these challenges, Avina provides a lifeline by transforming how sales representatives access and act on vital account information.

### How Does Avina Work?

Avina operates at the crossroads of marketing and sales, unearthing critical insights that often get buried in the noise. Think of it as a comprehensive resource that allows sales professionals to:

1. **Connect**: Seamlessly interfaces with existing marketing and sales platforms, gathering data from CRMs, ad tools, call records, and more.
   
2. **Collect**: It unifies internal and external data points, helping teams to zero in on what matters most – the intent and behavior of prospects, including real-time updates on what they engage with on your website.

3. **Convert**: Armed with actionable insights, Avina alerts sales teams when to engage and how to personalize their outreach based on individual account histories. 

This systematic approach ensures no opportunity slips through the cracks, converting potential leads into revenue with remarkable precision.

### Why Avina Stands Out

In a sea of generic AI tools promising to supercharge sales pipelines, Avina differentiates itself by adding depth to data. It’s not just about getting more leads; it’s about converting those leads into long-term customers. Many sales tools give superficial insights that don't translate into real-world success. Avina takes on the heavy lifting, ensuring that sales teams have timely, relevant information ready at their fingertips.

### Benefits of Avina

- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Sales reps get instant alerts on critical account activities, such as prospect engagement, so they can act swiftly.
- **Streamlined Communication**: Helps draft emails, LinkedIn messages, or texts tailored to individual prospects based on their activity.
- **Automated Briefs**: Compiles key insights into concise briefs for sales calls, saving hours of preparation time each week.
- **Rapid Onboarding**: Setup takes just 30 minutes, enabling teams to start utilizing the power of Avina swiftly.

### Recent Developments

Recently, Avina raised $3.2 million to further enhance its capabilities. This funding not only solidifies its position in the market but also forecasts future innovations to keep sellers equipped and informed.

**Mission**: Birch Biosciences is on a mission to revolutionize plastic recycling through innovative enzyme technology. By harnessing the power of engineered enzymes, they recycle plastics into valuable raw materials, fostering a circular economy.

**What They Do**: The company, founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S22, leverages synthetic biology and machine learning to create specialized enzymes that act like ""molecular scissors."" These enzymes effectively break down plastic polymers into chemical building blocks, which can then be used to produce high-quality recycled plastic products. This not only enhances the quality of recycled materials but also significantly reduces carbon emissions—by approximately 70%—compared to traditional plastic manufacturing methods.

**Location and Team**: Based in Portland, Oregon, Birch Biosciences operates with a dedicated team of ten employees, partnering with organizations like Nan in their journey towards sustainability.

**The Problem They're Solving**: In an age where only 9% of plastics are recycled, Birch targets the inefficiencies of existing recycling methods. Currently, most recycled plastics are of inferior quality and cost more than virgin materials derived from fossil fuels. By developing a reliable, cost-effective recycling process, Birch aims to create a sustainable solution to the plastic crisis and combat climate change.

**Technology**: Birch's recycling approach utilizes generative AI to enhance the performance of their enzymes, allowing for the transformation of plastic waste into new resources without the need for fossil fuels. This process not only matches the quality of newly manufactured plastics but also makes recycling economically viable.

**Recent Achievements**: Birch Biosciences has garnered attention for its innovative work, recently securing a $1 million NSF SBIR Phase II award to further advance its enzymatic recycling technology. They also received recognition from DARPA for their efforts in AI-driven enzyme engineering.

**Tags**: The company's focus areas include machine learning, synthetic biology, biotech, climate solutions, and climate technology.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S22,,,"Founded in 2022 and based in San Diego, California, Cisterna Biologics is a technology company. It aims to solve some of the challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",2022.0,"[{'name': 'Hari Bhaskaran, Founder', 'description': ""Hari Bhaskaran's journey with RNAs started with ribozymes (catalytic RNAs) almost 20 years ago in the labs of Rick Russell at UT Austin. His PhD work was focused on mechanistic understanding of RNA folding, culminating in a seminal publication in Nature (see Bhaskaran and Russell, 2007). Since then, he has held positions of increasing responsibilities in both academia and industry. He is the author of several publications and industry patents."", 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/hari-bhaskaran-7697a795/'}]","Cisterna Biologics, founded in 2022 and headquartered in San Diego, California, is tackling the pressing challenges in the biotech field, particularly in developing high-quality mRNA for therapeutic applications. As part of Y Combinator's Summer 2022 batch, this innovative technology company is set on a mission: to enhance the quality, quantity, longevity, and affordability of mRNA-based therapeutics.

So, what exactly does Cisterna bring to the table? The company leverages proprietary technologies that either eliminate contaminants at their source or replace the problematic elements entirely. For instance, to cut out double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), they employ ribozymes—these are like molecular scissors that trim the mRNA to ensure its purity and efficacy. They also use a PCR-like system to amplify DNA templates without the bacterial enrichment that usually introduces endotoxin contamination. This approach allows them to ensure mRNA that’s ten times higher in quality for therapeutic use.

With the mRNA technology landscape rapidly evolving, Cisterna is all about ensuring these advancements translate into real-world impact. They have a compact team of just two employees and are currently working on a pilot program, providing dT-purified and their SPEcific Capture and Cleavage (SPECC) purified mRNA to select research customers.

To summarize, Cisterna Biologics stands at the cutting edge of mRNA technology, with a clear mission to overcome the hurdles in producing high-quality mRNA that can usher in a new era of therapeutics.

Enter CompUp, an API-driven compensation benchmarking tool designed to provide real-time, accurate compensation data integrated smoothly with existing HR and payroll systems. This means no more tedious manual data entry; instead, organizations can access the latest benchmarks effortlessly.

**Overview**  
Founded in 2022 and incubated in the Y Combinator Batch S22, Coupl has emerged as India's pioneering neobank dedicated to modern couples. Located in Bengaluru, this eight-person team is on a mission to redefine how couples manage their shared finances, appealing not only to married partners but also to those in committed relationships or simply dating.

**The Problem**  
Traditionally, joint bank accounts in India have been mired in bureaucracy, available only to married couples and requiring cumbersome procedures and limited features. In contrast, modern relationships demand flexibility and ease, with couples often sharing expenses long before tying the knot. This disconnect between couples’ needs and available banking solutions presented a ripe opportunity.

**The Solution**  
Coupl addresses this gap by allowing any couple to open a digital joint wallet in under 60 seconds through a streamlined mobile app—no physical bank visit required. With Coupl, couples can pool their funds and manage joint expenses using linked RuPay cards. This innovative model replaces the tedious process of tracking who owes what with a simple shared account that handles all expenses seamlessly.

**User Experience**  
Coupl emphasizes speed and inclusivity. Couples can easily set up their accounts, invite partners, and start spending together. The experience is designed specifically for today’s needs, combining financial management with relationship dynamics, thus creating a platform where love and finances meet harmoniously.

**Rewards and Benefits**  
Further enhancing the appeal, Coupl rewards users with perks for spending together. From discounts on travel to entertainment subscriptions, the platform enriches couples' shared experiences while managing their finances. 

**Community Focus**  
Coupl also makes it a point to cater to diverse relationships, including same-sex couples, by providing a hassle-free setup catering to unique family needs.

**The Future**  
As they scale, Coupl aims to empower a generation of financially savvy couples who can navigate shared expenses without the traditional banking hurdles. With backing from notable entities like Y Combinator, the potential for this neobank looks promising.

While many accounting software options promise efficiency, they often fall short due to user complexity. Delegasi tackles this head-on, offering a streamlined automated accounting service that minimizes hassle for business owners who often grapple with financial statements. 

The mission? To make accounting straightforward. Business owners simply upload their receipts and bank statements, and Delegasi handles the rest. They ensure accurate financial statements and analyses, empowering owners to make informed decisions without the usual stress of accounting tasks.

**What They Offer:**
Delegasi’s services include:
- **Professional Financial Reporting**: This encompasses essential documents like profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow reports. They feature analyses that help businesses identify revenue channels and understand their financial health.
- **Business Analysis Services**: They provide tools for analyzing profitability across sales channels, break-even analysis, and even product mix strategies. 

**Why It Matters:** 
Built with the needs of SMBs in mind, Delegasi is particularly useful for those businesses experiencing fluctuating finances—where owners need accurate, detailed reports but lack the budget for a full-time accountant. This makes it indispensable for entrepreneurs looking to focus on scaling their operations rather than getting lost in the numbers.

**Recognition and Support**: 
Delegasi is part of Y Combinator’s Batch S22, which speaks volumes about their potential and innovation. With a small dedicated team of just eight, they are led by a capable group partner, Gustaf Alstromer, and they’ve already gained trust from over 400 SMB owners.

**Getting Started**: 
Prices start at Rp999,000 per month, which comes with a 25% discount based on monthly revenue. Their engaging approach and easy-to-use platform aim to transform the daunting task of financial management into a seamless experience.

For small business owners in Indonesia who wish to improve their accounting practices, Delegasi presents a compelling solution that combines automation with comprehensive financial reporting.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from the robust San Francisco Bay Area, **Delfino AI** is a promising startup that's tackling a persistent issue in healthcare: repetitive administrative tasks, particularly phone calls to payors. Born out of the Y Combinator Batch S22, this two-person team is on a mission to implement generative AI for automating these time-consuming duties, giving healthcare providers more bandwidth to focus on patient care.

### What Does Delfino AI Do?

Delfino AI's initial focus was on streamlining the administrative labyrinth by automating routine phone calls that healthcare providers make to insurance payors. Imagine not having to stay on hold or repeat the same eligibility questions again and again. Their AI-powered platform can navigate automated systems (IVRs), hold the line, and directly converse with live agents. Users simply send their call requests—like questions about patient eligibility or claim statuses—and let Delfino handle the rest. If the AI hits any snags, their helpful human fallback team steps in to ensure you still get the answers you need.

### Key Features and Benefits

1. **Time Savings**: By automating routine calls, providers can reallocate resources to higher-value tasks that enhance patient care.
   
2. **Knowledge Retention**: As teams shift and evolve, Delfino helps maintain essential operational knowledge, reducing information loss.
   
3. **Flexible Scaling**: The service can be scaled according to the needs of the healthcare organization, creating flexibility as demand changes.

### Compliance and Security

Delfino AI takes compliance seriously, utilizing Vanta to help monitor HIPAA adherence, ensuring that patient data is handled safely and securely.

### The Team Behind Delfino AI

While currently a small team of two, Delfino AI’s leaders boast impressive credentials from prestigious institutions like Stanford and MIT. It suggests that while they are lean, they bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to their work.

If you're a healthcare provider tired of drowning in repetitive calls to payors, Delfino AI might just be the lifebuoy you need.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S22,,,"EthosX is a decentralized finance platform creating end-to-end financial derivatives on blockchains. No centralized exchanges, clearinghouses, depositories, clearing banks, CSD participants etc. required.

We are starting with cryptocurrency options first, with the intention to move towards other crypto derivatives and traditional finance derivatives eventually.

For example, one can buy a bitcoin hedging token directly from EthosX without involving any exchange or counterparty and earn profits when the bitcoin price is falling (similar to a put option). It is perpetual and is completely on-chain, end-to-end. It is held as a token in wallets and can be sold/transferred to anyone at any time.

At institutional level, using EthosX’s options infrastructure two hedge funds can trade high-value on-chain options with each other directly without involving any banks or brokers with zero counterparty risk and zero settlement risk.

We are also providing derivatives infrastructure to other crypto companies who want to use these products as a part of a larger package to their customers.

Global derivatives ecosystem is broken. Derivatives trading in traditional finance has way too many gatekeepers and intermediaries. Crypto was supposed to be free of these issues and a solution to all of this, but it is itself getting more and more centralized with disastrous consequences.

**Company Name**: EthosX  
**Founded**: 2022  
**Location**: Claymont, DE  
**Team Size**: 2 employees  
**Y Combinator**: Batch S22  

**Mission**: EthosX aims to create a decentralized protocol for financial derivatives on blockchain, providing a seamless trading experience free of intermediaries.

### What They Do

EthosX is pioneering a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that's reshaping how derivatives are traded. Their initial focus is on cryptocurrency options, with plans to eventually expand into a broader range of crypto and traditional financial derivatives. 

Imagine being able to buy a hedging token for Bitcoin directly from EthosX—no exchanges or counterparty risk involved. This allows traders to profit, even when market prices fall, akin to a put option. Everything is managed on-chain, meaning trading is transparent and can be conducted at any time.

On the institutional level, EthosX's infrastructure empowers hedge funds to conduct high-value options trading directly with one another. This eliminates the need for banks or brokers, reducing both counterparty and settlement risk. 

Additionally, they're building a derivatives infrastructure for other crypto companies, enhancing their offerings without the hassle of extra intermediaries.

### The Problem at Hand

Traditional derivatives trading is bogged down by layers of intermediaries—think exchanges, clearinghouses, banks, and custodians. Conversely, the crypto ecosystem is fast becoming centralized, threatening the very freedom it promised. EthosX believes there's a better way to bridge these two worlds and take back that freedom in derivatives trading, ensuring a transparent, efficient, and user-empowered experience.

### Key Features

- **Direct Market Access**: Users can trade derivatives on assets like BTC, ETH, and various altcoins without intermediaries.
- **Transparent Transactions**: All transactions are clear and straightforward, giving traders confidence over their assets.
- **Real-Time Data & Insights**: EthosX provides advanced analytics tools, helping both retail and institutional traders make informed decisions based on current market conditions.
- **Derivatives RFQ Platform**: Users can easily request quotes for various derivative options, making trading simpler.
- **On-Chain Clearing**: Transactions are streamlined through secure and transparent automated processes.

### Culture and Philosophy

At its core, EthosX is about empowerment—giving traders (both retail and institutional) more control over their trades while simplifying the process. The ethos here is that trading derivatives should not be a labyrinthine process; it should be as straightforward, direct, and risk-aware as possible.

### Community Engagement

EthosX encourages users to join their community, participate in rewards campaigns, and access educational resources designed to improve trading strategies and capabilities.

Founded by a team with a history of building successful data applications, Firecrawl's core mission is pretty straightforward: to provide the easiest way to extract AI-ready data from the web.

Initially branded to simply extract data from websites, Firecrawl has swiftly evolved into a powerful tool for developers. Its API allows users to take any URL and convert it into LLM (Large Language Model) ready markdown or structured data with just a single API call. The platform gained impressive traction, racking up over 17,000 GitHub stars in a mere two months and managing to secure paying customers from the start.

Before launching Firecrawl, the founders developed Mendable, a pioneering application for conversing with data, catering to high-profile clients like MongoDB, Coinbase, and Snapchat. Their past experience highlighted a common frustration: the complex and often unreliable processes involved in web data extraction. This insight laid the groundwork for Firecrawl’s streamlined approach.

### Key Features:
- **Robust Web Scraping**: Firecrawl can crawl and scrape data from all accessible subpages, returning clean markdown without needing a sitemap.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: It accommodates sites that render content dynamically using JavaScript.
- **AI-Ready Data**: The content is structured effectively, enabling LLM applications to leverage it with minimal preprocessing.
- **Open Source**: True to modern tech ethos, Firecrawl is open-source, encouraging contributions and community involvement.

### User Experience:
Developers can kickstart their journey with Firecrawl for free (up to 500 credits), making it easy to try out the service before committing to a paid plan. Their pricing tiers offer flexible scaling options, which range from basic plans for hobbyists to comprehensive enterprise solutions.

Firecrawl has already attracted attention from notable companies and developers, who praise its reliability and efficiency in data preparation. Feedback suggests it's not just a tool but a valuable partner in ai-powered projects.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S22,,,"FlyCode Dunning & Payment Management AI that helps subscription merchants maximize revenue. We reduce passive churn by managing payment failures intelligently.

We’re Jake, Etai, and TD and we’re building FlyCode.

TL;DR: If you sell SaaS or B2C subscriptions, we’re here to help you recover lost revenue due to failed payments and involuntary churn.

‘Involuntary’ or ‘Passive’ churn is a hidden Revenue Killer 💳 for Subscription Businesses

❌ THE PROBLEM: Recovering Failed Payments is Complex
Involuntary churn refers to the loss of subscribers due to payment failures, not due to them actively canceling. While it is both possible and a worthwhile strategy to attempt to win back a customer during the cancellation process — involuntary churn is not intentional and in most cases, your customers aren’t even aware that their payment failed.

💰 Bottom line?
Effective payment optimization does reduce involuntary churn and will increase ARR by as much as 5-10%

FLYCODE SOLUTION 💡
FlyCode leverages ML and AI to provide Payment Optimization and smart payment retries to maximize subscription revenue and reduce churn. We apply a unique model tailored to each Merchant and their customers to ensure optimal results.

⚡️Automatically recover failed subscription payments and reduce passive churn

⚡️Use ML & AI based payment optimization to find the best time to charge your customers

⚡️ Improve customer experience by coordinating payment retries with customer emails/SMS

**Founders and Team:**  
FlyCode was founded in 2021 by Jake, Etai, and TD and is based in Boston. The team is comprised of 7 employees and is part of Y Combinator's Batch S22. Nicolas Dessaigne serves as their Group Partner.

**Mission:**  
FlyCode’s mission is clear: help subscription businesses recover failed payments, thereby boosting retention rates and increasing Lifetime Value (LTV). 

**The Problem:**  
Subscription businesses often face what is known as **involuntary churn**—revenue lost not because customers actively cancel but due to payment failures. This is a significant but often overlooked issue that can be a silent killer of revenue. For many companies, ranging from SaaS to e-commerce, the ability to recover lost payments can lead to a 5-10% increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).

**The Solution:**  
FlyCode leverages **machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)** to optimize payment processes and implement smart retry strategies. Here’s how it works:
- **Automated Recovery:** The system automatically retries failed subscription payments, minimizing passive churn without adding to your workload.
- **Intelligent Timing:** FlyCode’s ML models determine the best times to charge customers, enhancing the likelihood of successful payments.
- **Enhanced Customer Engagement:** Coordinated payment retries are coupled with helpful customer communications via email or SMS, improving the overall customer experience.

**Integrations and Reach:**  
FlyCode supports both out-of-the-box and custom integrations, particularly with established platforms like **Stripe** and **Shopify**, allowing merchants to integrate smoothly into their existing systems. They also offer white-label solutions for platforms seeking to enhance their payment management capabilities.

**Recognition:**  
FlyCode was recently recognized as a winner at the **Visa Everywhere Initiative**, showcasing their industry impact and innovative approach to payment management.

**Target Audience:**  
If you sell SaaS or B2C subscriptions and are losing revenue to failed payments, FlyCode is tailored for you.

**Bottom Line:**  
In a world where every dollar counts, FlyCode provides subscription businesses with the tools they need to turn failed payments into opportunities. Instead of losing out on revenue due to inadvertent payment lapses, businesses can now recover and retain customers more effectively. It’s a game-changer in subscription billing.

Grai is a startup that emerged from Y Combinator Batch S22 in 2021, operating out of San Francisco. At its core, Grai champions open-source version control but with a specific focus: metadata management. The fundamental problem they tackle is the complexity of understanding how database changes might influence machine learning models, APIs, and dashboards—especially when these systems are silos that don’t naturally communicate. This is crucial in today's data-heavy landscape, where knowing the relationships between data points can mean the difference between success and failure for applications and insights. 

**Mission**

Grai’s mission is straightforward: provide an open-source platform for version controlling metadata. This means they offer tools that allow teams to track changes to their data pipelines in a way that anticipates and mitigates issues before they hit production. 

**Current Offerings**

Right now, Grai offers a set of key features that include:

1. **Data Discovery**: This functionality speeds up the process of locating the right datasets. Users can filter and search across their data ecosystems and trace data sources in depth.
  
2. **Advanced Testing**: Perhaps the most critical aspect, this feature automatically tests data changes during continuous integration (CI). It identifies issues before they propagate into production environments, thus maintaining data integrity. 

3. **Developer Focus**: Grai prioritizes community involvement. It's open-source, meaning anyone can contribute and modify it. If your specific stack isn’t supported, you can easily submit a pull request to get it integrated.

**Integration and Community**

Grai is designed to integrate with various tools and platforms—whether on bare metal or cloud environments. Their ecosystem includes a variety of connectors, making it compatible across the board with popular tools such as Metabase, Fivetran, and BigQuery.

Additionally, Grai nurtures a community for developers via a Slack channel where users can discuss features, issues, and best practices, making it a collaborative space for improvement and innovation.

**The Vision Ahead**

The Grai team of three is small but mighty. Their Group Partner, Dalton Caldwell, guides their vision and strategy as they navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead in data engineering and open-source development.

In a data world that's increasingly complex, Grai positions itself as a vital tool that not only helps users understand their data but also equips them to manage it proactively. For those interested in trying it out, Grai offers a free starting point to dive right into its functionalities.

**Overview:**  
Guardian Bio is a Boston-based biotech company founded in 2022 that's on a mission to transform cancer therapy using a novel dendritic cell-based platform. The company operates under the belief that the immune system—our body’s most potent defense against cancer—can be enhanced, particularly through the revitalization of dendritic cells. 

**What They Do:**  
Dendritic cells play a critical role in guiding immune responses; however, research shows these cells often become dysfunctional in cancer patients, which can stymie the effectiveness of other treatments. Guardian Bio uniquely addresses this issue by creating tailored therapeutic dendritic cells that are derived from patients' own stem cells. This product not only revitalizes the immune system’s killer cells but also trains them to target multiple cancer types, boosting anti-tumor activity.

**The Technology:**  
Guardian Bio has developed a proprietary process to produce specialized dendritic cells, termed Guard-cDC1s, which effectively restore immune functionality. These cells are pivotal in reinstating antigen presentation capabilities that are often compromised in late-stage cancer. By training these cells against specific tumor targets, Guardian Bio enhances the body’s natural immune responses, making it a promising frontrunner in cancer therapy.

**Team and Education:**  
The founding team includes Ananya Zutshi, who has extensive experience in the biotech sector and education from prestigious institutions such as Duke and Harvard, and Karolina Palucka, a luminary in cancer immunology. Both co-founders are committed to harnessing advanced science to bring innovative solutions to market. The team also includes Richard Barrett, who brings a strong background in immunology and science communication.

**Affiliation and Growth:**  
Part of Y Combinator's Summer 2022 batch, Guardian Bio is poised for growth in the biotech and healthcare realms. Their work is tagged under key sectors like therapeutics and oncology, signaling their focus on impactful areas within the cancer treatment landscape.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

**Gullak Money** is reimagining the way Indians save and invest by leveraging the cultural affinity for gold. Launched just 60 days ago, this fintech start-up has experienced rapid growth, scaling to **40,000 transacting users** and achieving a **monthly Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of $280,000**—and growing at a **25% week-over-week** rate. 

### Mission and Vision

At the core of Gullak's mission is the automation of savings and investing those savings in gold, a cherished asset in India. Currently, around **200 million Indians** save manually in traditional banking options, which often provide returns that hardly keep pace with inflation. Gullak aims to nudge these savers towards smarter, wealth-creating methods.

### The Gold Affinity

Gold purchases in India hit approximately **$30 billion annually**, predominantly from middle-income households. Despite gold's historical performance (typically yielding **5% more** than bank deposits), many individuals remain stuck in less effective savings habits due to the cumbersome nature of acquiring and storing physical gold.

Gullak simplifies this by allowing users to automate small, regular savings (starting at just **$1 a day**) into **digital gold**. This capability only became feasible with the rise of UPI Autopay, which has made recurring transactions seamless.

### Market Potential

With an estimated **50 million Indians** saving $2 daily, and considering gold-backed lending opportunities, the market potential is projected to be around **$1.5 billion**. This presents an exciting horizon for a company like Gullak, which is strategically positioned at the intersection of saving, investing, and the gold market.

### The Team Behind Gullak

The founding team is notable, having previously developed the **BHIM UPI App**, which saw **10 million downloads within 10 days** of launch. This group comes with substantial experience in building large-scale payment systems for leading partners like **Google Pay** and **Amazon**, processing over **30 million payments daily**. They have also been instrumental in creating over **40 consumer brands** in their previous ventures.

### Recent Progress

Founded in **2022** and part of the **Y Combinator Batch S22**, Gullak has quickly built a solid foundation with a dedicated team of **15 employees** based in **Bengaluru, India**. Recently, they secured **INR 10 crore in pre-seed funding** from well-reputed investors like **Better Capital** and **Stellaris Venture Partners**.

### User Experience and Features

Gullak's app is designed to simplify saving, allowing users to:
- Set automatic payments and reminders,
- Invest in **100% secure 24k gold**,
- Save as little as **₹50/day**, 
- Withdraw savings in cash or gold at any time.

Additionally, it includes features such as **daily savings plans**, **gold delivery** options, and opportunities to earn rewards through referrals or special occasions—making the platform not just a savings tool but a rewarding experience.

### Conclusion

Gullak Money is fundamentally changing the way individuals in India save and invest, marrying a time-honored tradition with modern technology. By automating the process and making it user-friendly, they not only provide better returns than traditional savings methods but also empower users to cultivate a more secure financial future in a culturally significant asset class.

The company is on a mission that’s both innovative and sustainable: they’re building robotic mushroom farms. By automating the growing process and using AI to optimize conditions, Hedgehog aims to reduce labor costs and increase yields, making it possible to produce mushrooms for less than a third of what leading growers do.

Why mushrooms? They’re not just tasty; fungi have the potential to transform our food systems. They convert agricultural waste into protein-rich foods while leaving a minimal environmental footprint. Hedgehog sees fungi as the next major food source, harnessing technology to unlock this potential.

The team behind Hedgehog is small but mighty, consisting of just four employees. Under the guidance of Y Combinator partner Jared Friedman, they’re tackling some of the biggest challenges in food production and climate impact. With tags like 'artificial-intelligence', 'robotics', and 'food-tech', it’s clear they’re melding advanced tech with agricultural science, all while being stationed in the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area.

Hedgehog's offerings are diverse, showcasing a range of mushrooms grown locally in Tennessee, including shiitake, oyster, and pioppino mushrooms—all certified organic. They pride themselves on being regeneratively farmed and sustainably sourced, catering to culinary enthusiasts and local restaurants alike.

**Overview**  
Founded in 2022 and hailing from the prestigious Y Combinator Batch S22, HyperDX is spearheading a new era in engineering with its mission of delivering open-source, developer-friendly observability tools. Located in San Mateo, California, the company is small but mighty, consisting of a dedicated team of four.

**What They Do**  
HyperDX started by addressing a crucial pain point for engineers: resolving production bugs swiftly. It accomplishes this by offering a streamlined workflow that aggregates alerts and debugging telemetry in one place—logs, metrics, traces, and even browser session replays. Setting it up? You're looking at just minutes before you start resolving issues faster than ever. 

One of the standout features is the ability to correlate every request from a user’s browser all the way through to backend servers and async workers, automating the tracing process. This is particularly useful for high-velocity engineering teams who need to act immediately to resolve issues without getting bogged down by cumbersome tooling.

**Cost Efficiency**   
HyperDX is not just about speed; it’s also refreshingly cost-effective. By leveraging Clickhouse and S3, they offer significant savings—up to ten times cheaper than traditional monitoring solutions like Datadog. Pricing is straightforward, charging $0.40 per GB without costs per user or host, enabling teams to focus on building rather than worrying about the observability bill.

**Open Source Philosophy**  
The company embodies the spirit of open-source. They provide a platform that not only promotes transparency but also encourages collaboration within the community. With tools designed to be vendor-agnostic and an easy setup with minimal friction, HyperDX empowers developers to instrument their applications seamlessly, avoiding vendor lock-in.

**Features & Integrations**  
HyperDX includes a range of powerful features like:
- **Log Patterns**: Instantly cluster and analyze similar logs.
- **Correlated Session Replays**: Link session replays directly with backend logs.
- **Intuitive Search Tools**: Easy-to-use search functionality without convoluted syntax.
- **Visualization Tools**: An advanced chart builder for detailed insights.

Moreover, it integrates effortlessly with existing tools. Want Slack alerts when something goes wrong? Done. Need to jump from Intercom straight to a user’s session? No problem.

**The Future**  
As they continue to refine their offerings and expand their community, HyperDX is poised to be a game changer in the observability space. Their blend of speed, simplicity, and savings is a refreshing take that can easily disrupt the traditional players who have dominated the market for too long.

They simplify the cumbersome processes involved in registration, data management, and broker transactions of RECs. The platform takes care of the regulatory paperwork and ensures that users get paid smoothly—so much so that all you have to do is register your solar system (for free) and watch the magic happen.

Their user-friendly approach means you can easily verify generator information, compare prices, and buy or trade any volume of energy credits. Jasmine ensures no hidden fees creep in, offering transparent pricing and straightforward contracting that caters to various capacities.

#### Audience and Services

Jasmine Energy tailors its services to three main groups:

1. **Homeowners with Rooftop Solar** - Aimed at maximizing the value of their energy production while managing RECs efficiently.
2. **Third-Party Owners (TPO)** - For those owning small-scale solar systems, Jasmine offers a way to manage RECs with ease.
3. **Independent Power Producers (IPP)** - Catering to utility-scale producers by optimizing REC value and handling the bureaucratic load.

Each category has tailored fee structures, designed to ensure that users can capitalize on their contributions to green energy.

#### Why It Matters

At its core, Jasmine Energy is not just about trading energy certificates; it’s about building a more transparent and inclusive market for climate assets. With a focus on decentralization and accessibility, they aim to democratize the renewable energy landscape.

Their intuitive platform aligns perfectly with the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions, reflective of a shifting societal mindset toward environmental responsibility. The potential to trade energy credits effectively could pave the way for broader adoption of renewable sources.

Kamion is carving out a significant niche in Turkey's logistics sector, often dubbed the ""Uber for Trucks."" Founded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch S22, Kamion seeks to streamline an industry ripe for innovation. With around 850,000 independent truckers and a logistics market valued at $73 billion, Turkey presents a robust opportunity for a digital freight network like Kamion.

### The Problem

In the current landscape, freight forwarding in Turkey relies heavily on traditional means—numerous phone calls, emails, and face-to-face interactions. The trucking sector is highly fragmented, with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) controlling about 95% of the market share. This inefficiency hampers speed and sustainability, which is precisely where Kamion aims to make a difference.

### The Solution

Kamion connects businesses needing trucks with carriers looking for loads, thereby providing an efficient platform for both shippers and carriers. By leveraging technology, they not only reduce the need for human interaction but also gather critical data to optimize logistics operations. Their platform champions visibility, efficiency, and sustainability—helping users minimize carbon emissions and reduce empty miles.

### Team and Support

Based in Istanbul, Kamion operates with a committed team of 35 employees, driving the company's mission forward. Notably, they offer 24/7 phone support with a dedicated logistics team that boasts decades of experience. Their flexible approach has garnered praise from clients such as Evyap Holding and Pepsico for professionalism and operational excellence.

### Market Position and Funding

Kamion is well-positioned within the logistics marketplace, having secured backing from elite venture capital funds, including Y Combinator, Soma Capital, and others. This backing not only provides financial support but also lends credibility as Kamion scales its operations.

### User Engagement

The platform services over 200 happy clients and continues to expand its reach. They provide services that range from spot shipments to contract freight, making it easy for shippers to manage their logistics workflows through a singular platform. Kamion advocates for a greener freight system, aiming to substantially reduce carbon footprints through advanced data analytics.

### Conclusion

In summary, Kamion is not just another startup; it’s a forward-thinking solution to an outdated logistics system in one of the MENA region's largest economies. With effective technology and a focus on sustainability, they're setting a new standard for how trucking can be done in Turkey and, potentially, beyond. For businesses looking to simplify shipping, reduce operational costs, and embrace greener practices, Kamion presents a compelling option.

**Company Overview**  
Founded in 2022, Keylika is a burgeoning biopharma startup based in Walnut Creek, California. As part of the Y Combinator Batch S22, the company's mission zeroes in on revolutionizing treatment for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) through innovative metal-based drugs and advanced delivery technologies.

**Innovative Approach**  
Keylika has developed a groundbreaking small molecule iron drug, now formatted as a wearable skin patch, aimed at treating IDA with far greater safety and tolerability compared to existing therapies. This skin patch—the world's first prescription iron patch—delivers iron directly into the bloodstream, steering clear of the gastrointestinal distress often associated with oral supplements, like nausea or constipation. 

**Market Need**  
Iron deficiency is a serious, yet frequently understated condition, impacting around 1.6 billion people globally and over 30 million in the United States alone. Current treatments, such as oral iron supplements, have limited efficacy and poor patient compliance due to their side effects. Intravenous iron infusions might be effective but come with their own risks and costs. Keylika is poised to fill this gap with its proprietary transdermal iron solution, NistuFe, combining the convenience of oral intake with the effective delivery found in IV treatments, minus the downsides.

**Technology Backbone**  
At the heart of Keylika’s technology is a platform synthesis that allows the creation of metal-based drugs optimized for various therapeutic needs. This innovative method not only enhances drug absorption but also reduces systemic toxicity, providing clinicians and patients a much-needed advancement in IDA treatment.

**Leadership**  
The venture is helmed by co-founders Buddhadev P. Chaudhuri and Frederik Ceyssens, both of whom bring extensive expertise in material science, microtechnology, and drug delivery. With a combined 30+ years in research and development, they are committed to ushering in a new era of treatment for iron deficiency.

**Current Status**  
As of now, Keylika operates with a small team, pointing to the agility and focused approach of a startup. Their ongoing work positions them at the closest intersection of medical innovation and practical healthcare delivery, a promising indicator of disruption in a stagnant market.

In summary, Keylika isn't just developing drugs; they're reshaping patient care for millions who silently suffer from iron deficiency anemia. Their innovative, patient-centered solution stands poised to make a significant impact on public health.

Founded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S22, Knowtex is on a mission to enhance the efficiency of healthcare professionals. With a headquarters in San Francisco, the company aims to make doctors twice as efficient through advanced AI-driven note-taking and charge capture technologies.

The healthcare industry is facing a crisis. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have introduced a massive documentation burden, leading to doctor burnout and high attrition rates. In fact, a staggering $125 billion is lost annually due to inadequate documentation and complex medical coding—which now boasts an overwhelming 145,000 codes. To tackle these challenges, Knowtex leverages AI and voice technology, transforming doctor-patient conversations into detailed notes and accurate billing codes.

### Key Features
- **Automated Workflows**: Knowtex eliminates the tedious administrative tasks, saving clinicians over two hours a day by generating detailed notes directly from conversations.
- **Accurate Billing**: Instantly creates ICD-10, E&M, HCC, and CPT codes tailored to the complexity of the interaction, ensuring providers get paid what they're due.
- **Multilingual Capabilities**: The software can understand accents and dialects from over 99 languages, making it accessible to a diverse range of patients.
- **Easy Integration**: Knowtex integrates seamlessly with most EHR systems, allowing for smooth transitions and historical data synthesis.

### User Testimonials
The voices of satisfied users are powerful. Doctors report significantly reduced time spent on documentation, allowing them to focus more on patient care. For example, physicians have noted improvements in their work-life balance, with many expressing joy in connecting more deeply with their patients during visits instead of being distracted by typing notes.

### The Impact
By providing a streamlined, AI-powered solution to documentation and billing, Knowtex addresses a critical pain point in healthcare. As clinicians become more efficient, they can devote more attention to patient care, ultimately improving outcomes and satisfaction for both doctors and patients.

Founded in 2021 and based in vibrant New York, **Novig** is more than just another sports betting platform. It positions itself as the **first prediction market for sports**, offering a fresh take on how fans engage with betting. Rather than playing against a traditional house, users can now bet directly against friends or the market, essentially creating a two-sided marketplace that makes betting not only fairer but also more profitable.

### What They Offer

One of the standout features of Novig is its innovative approach—allowing users to set their own odds or pick from the best available lines. This flexibility grants bettors maximum control over their wagers, upending the outdated “against the house” paradigm where the odds are never in your favor. The unique setup of Novig claims to increase users' chances of winning by a factor of ten compared to conventional sportsbooks.

**Key Features:**

- **No-Vig Model**: Users enjoy more favorable odds without the usual “vig” or commission that typically eats into profits.
- **Community Betting**: Bet against friends or an open market instead of the house, making for a more engaging and interactive experience.
- **Dual Play Options**: Novig allows users to bet with fun, non-redeemable coins or real cash, with bonuses and rewards for engaged players.

### The Team and Backing

With a compact team of 12, Novig benefits from guidance under **Dalton Caldwell**, a partner at **Y Combinator**, where Novig participated in the Summer 2022 batch. This pedigree speaks volumes about its potential in a competitive space.

### Statistics and Growth

As of now, Novig is available in **42 states** across the U.S., making it accessible to a large audience eager for a new betting experience. Its users are reported to be **43% profitable**, a stark contrast to the 3% profitability often cited among competitors. This kind of user satisfaction could hint at a strong future ahead.

Founded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S22, Paragon AI is a San Francisco-based startup that's laser-focused on enhancing the productivity of sales representatives. Their mission? To automatically transform sales call recordings into structured CRM data. This innovation allows sales reps to ditch mind-numbing tasks like sifting through call transcripts and data entry—essentially freeing them up to do what they do best: selling.

Paragon AI works by leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology. It listens to sales calls and directly populates CRM systems with critical information, ensuring that data remains current and actionable. This not only streamlines the workflow for sales teams but also gives sales leaders confidence that their pipeline data is up-to-date.

Here’s how it operates:

1. **Automatic Note-taking**: Paragon AI summarizes call content into concise notes, capturing the essence of discussions without any manual effort.
2. **Data Points**: It extracts vital details such as customer budget, decision-makers, and timelines, filling out custom fields in the CRM with ease.
3. **Q&A Capture**: The tool records questions posed by the sales rep and answers from the prospective client, making sure that every relevant detail is documented.
4. **Additional Insights**: It also collects call notes that might not have been solicited but are still invaluable for follow-ups and relationship building.

- **Identifying Orders**: It scans through emails and WhatsApp messages to filter legitimate orders from various formats, such as typed messages, PDFs, or even handwritten notes.
- **Extraction & Matching**: It extracts key customer details and matches them with product codes in the ERP system, ensuring accuracy.
- **Exporting to ERP or CRM**: Once matched, Sanifu automatically populates these orders into the chosen integrated ERP or CRM system, dramatically reducing processing time.

This automation is not just efficient; it enhances overall business productivity, allowing teams to focus on more strategic tasks rather than repetitive data entry. 

#### Key Features of Sanifu
- **Email Integration**: Automatically processes incoming orders sent via email, regardless of format (text or PDF).
- **WhatsApp Functionality**: Orders sent through WhatsApp are similarly processed, whether they use natural language or handwritten notes sent as images.
- **Support for Unstructured Data**: Sanifu can handle various types of documents, including scanned and handwritten materials.
- **Broad Compatibility**: It integrates with a wide range of platforms, including popular services like Google Mail, Microsoft products, and ERP systems from major vendors like SAP and Oracle.

Instead, it embraces open-source principles to offer developers and marketing teams the control they need.

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Deploy applications across multiple clients effortlessly.
- **Localization**: Cater to diverse markets with ease.
- **Visual Editing**: Create and visualize content beautifully without needing extensive coding skills.
- **Digital Asset Management**: Organize and manage your digital assets effectively.

Payload caters to a vast range of use cases: Headless CMS, Enterprise App Builder, Headless E-Commerce, and Digital Asset Management among others.

**The Community and Resources**  
With a focus on community engagement, Payload offers extensive documentation, examples, and a roadmap for users to stay involved in the platform's growth. Developers can find help on platforms such as Discord, while also having access to a rich repository of templates on GitHub.

**Partnered Success**  
Companies like Microsoft and Blue Origin are already leveraging Payload to enhance their content management flows. These case studies illustrate how Payload can accelerate development processes and deliver custom solutions rapidly.

Founded in 2022 and hailing from Toronto, Canada, Provision is part of Y Combinator's Batch S22. With a compact yet dynamic team of nine, their mission is to streamline the construction industry's approach to contract analysis. The essence of their innovation? An intelligent platform that cuts through the tedious noise of contract documents, making it easier for constructors to save time and dodge costly mistakes.

### The Problem They Solve

In construction, time is money and misreading a contract can lead to significant financial repercussions. Provision addresses this dilemma by offering a platform that organizes and extracts vital information from extensive document sets. Instead of painstakingly combing through pages of text, users can quickly sift through contracts to find the risks and requirements that matter most.

### Key Features

1. **Contract Review**: Gain insights quickly through a standardized review process that highlights risks and crucial points in contracts.
   
2. **Project Co-Pilot**: Navigate through monumental documents with ease; focus on critical areas while bypassing irrelevant information to understand the contract better.

3. **Instant Risk Identification**: Potential issues, whether they're crucial qualifications or operational restrictions, are flagged promptly, ensuring nothing slips under the radar before bids are submitted.

4. **Specifications & Drawing Notes**: Quickly retrieve competitive edge information which is vital for operations.

5. **Automated Reconciliation**: Supplemental conditions are reconciled automatically, saving you from hours of manual verification.

### Who Benefits?

Provision is particularly tailored for pre-construction teams and legal experts. It allows teams to filter out unsuitable projects, surface critical information before bids, and streamline risk reviews across various projects.

### Security First

With SOC2 certification, Provision prioritizes data integrity and security. They ensure that all data is protected both in transit and at rest, providing clients with peace of mind.

### Proven Impact

The effectiveness of Provision is echoed through glowing customer feedback. Industry professionals from firms like M.

Founded in 2022 by six former OneWeb engineers, Quindar's mission is to provide a seamless environment for monitoring and automating satellite missions. Think of it as Google Docs for satellites—where multiple operators can manage fleets without getting buried under the weight of traditional complexities.

The space landscape is changing rapidly; once, managing satellites meant launching a few every decade. Now, we're in an era where companies are rolling out hundreds of satellites in just a few years! Quindar's Software as a Service (SaaS) platform is designed for this rapid expansion. It allows a single engineer to operate hundreds of satellites—a significant leap from the old method where many engineers were needed for just one satellite. 

Based in Denver, Colorado, Quindar is part of Y Combinator's S22 batch, securing initial funding that speaks volumes about its potential. Their offering includes services like Mission Planning, Command & Control, Flight Dynamics, and Incident Management, tailored for satellite owners, manufacturers, and defense organizations.

What sets Quindar apart is not just its technology but also the team's deep industry experience. They come from backgrounds that include helping build the software platform behind the second largest satellite constellation in the world. 

Their platform stands out with an open architecture, making it easy to integrate with existing systems—essential for companies that want to scale without being tied down by vendor lock-in. 

The company is moving fast, with over 250 satellites in their management backlog and a promise of up to 99% Service Level Agreements (SLAs). With advancements in analytics and machine learning on the horizon, their goal is to provide actionable insights that will redefine satellite mission management.

So, if you're looking to streamline your satellite operations and stay ahead in the space race, Quindar is worth checking out.

At its core, Raven combines decades of manufacturing expertise with cutting-edge artificial intelligence to address real, gritty problems in operational settings. The company offers tailored solutions for mundane tasks like training, job planning, troubleshooting, and reporting, all while integrating seamlessly with existing systems. This means you don't have to toss out what already works; instead, Raven enhances it.

**Challenges in Manufacturing**: Raven has identified several pain points in the industry:
- **Scattered Information**: Companies waste up to 2-4 hours per incident searching for critical data due to information fragmentation.
- **Knowledge Silos**: Vital expertise remains locked away, increasing safety risks by as much as 40% and triggering repetitive problem-solving efforts.
- **Inconsistent Execution**: Variable process adherence leads to fluctuating quality and can burn out expert staff, who currently spend about 60% of their time on routine tasks.
- **Slow Knowledge Transfer**: New engineers face a steep 12-18 month learning curve, while organizations grapple with over $1 million in annual productivity losses.

**What Raven Does**:  
Here’s how Raven tackles these issues with its AI assistants:
1. **Connect Your Data Universe**: Integrates data from various sources—ERP systems, SOPs, maintenance logs, and more—into one cohesive system.
2. **Automate Daily Workflows**: Transforms complex, time-consuming tasks into one-click actions.
3. **Ask Questions, Get Insights**: Provides intuitive answers to inquiries about performance trends and troubleshooting, using natural language processing.
4. **Generate Reports**: Automatically pulls data to create actionable insights and reports.

**Use Cases**:  
Raven has real-world applications that demonstrate its value:
- **Automated Permit Preparation**: Streamlines the gathering of various essential documents for maintenance tasks.
- **Faster Troubleshooting**: Helps to quickly resolve operational issues by automating data collection and analysis.
- **New Hire Training**: Accelerates onboarding with systematic knowledge transfer through contextual guidance.

**Industries Served**: Raven is particularly focused on sectors like chemicals, fertilizers, petrochemicals, oil & gas, energy, and utilities.

The results speak volumes. Clients, such as a global chemical manufacturer in Sub-Saharan Africa, have reported significant reductions in time needed for permit preparation, enhancing both safety and compliance throughout their operations.

**Why Choose Raven?**  
With a team made up of former managers, engineers, and AI specialists, Raven leverages over 30 years of industrial experience from reputable companies like Reliance and ONGC Petro Additives. This unique blend of expertise positions Raven to deliver AI solutions that genuinely meet the needs of modern manufacturing.

In short, Raven isn’t just selling a product; it's offering a transformation in how manufacturing plants operate. If you’re looking to modernize and streamline your operations, Raven might just be your ideal partner.

The company has a focused mission: to develop an injectable gel that addresses the debilitating pain of knee osteoarthritis—a condition that approximately half the population faces at some point. 

Osteoarthritis is a progressive disease, and current treatment regimes often involve not just frequent injections but also reliance on strong oral medications. This paradigm frequently leads patients to highly addictive opioids as they seek relief. Relevium's innovative therapy aims to disrupt this pattern by offering a safer, more effective alternative. Their injectable gel has completed preclinical testing, boasting a safety profile that selectively blocks pain-transmitting nerves and delivers pain relief capable of lasting four times longer than conventional options.

Financially, Relevium has secured $3.7 million in non-dilutive funding, illustrating confidence in their ambitious plans. In a landscape where the US market alone for knee osteoarthritis treatments is pegged at a staggering $7.7 billion, the company’s prospects are bright. Their focus doesn’t end with the knee; they're also exploring applications for other joints like the hip and ankle, where similar challenges exist.

Part of the Y Combinator Batch S22, Relevium is a small team of five, but their vision is grand. They are leveraging natural biopolymers combined with pharmacologically active agents, crafting a robust pipeline of hydrogel products tailored for chronic pain. Their approach underscores a commitment to innovation and excellence, aiming to enhance patient outcomes significantly.

Its mission is to tackle one of the biggest challenges in oncology: overcoming cancer treatment resistance through rationally designed combination therapies. 

The core of Serinus's approach lies in leveraging a state-of-the-art AI platform, named ResCuETM, which blends decades of systems biology insights with advanced computational capabilities. This enables the company to identify vulnerabilities in drug-resistant cancer cells and to propose drug combinations that are not only safer and more effective but also expediently accessible to patients.

Founded by a team of MIT PhDs and supported by an impressive Scientific Advisory Board that includes experts from the Broad Institute, Dana-Farber, and UC San Diego, Serinus is on a mission to revolutionize precision medicine. 

The reality is stark: more than 85% of cancer mortality is linked to drug resistance, yet current approaches to mapping these resistance mechanisms are labor-intensive and historically ineffective. Serinus is addressing this gap by systematically uncovering how cancer cells evolve to evade treatments and what alternative therapeutic strategies can be devised.

With a highly skilled team of six, Serinus is not only innovating at the intersection of biotech and AI but is actively seeking collaborations with pharma and biotech leaders to fast-track developments in tackling treatment-resistant cancers.

Founded in 2022 as part of the Y Combinator Batch S22, Signatur Biosciences is a London-based biotech startup on a mission to deliver “simple tests for complex diseases.” With a compact team of five, the company aims to revolutionize precision diagnostics, starting with a focus on breast cancer prognosis.

**The Problem: Accessibility of Precision Diagnostics**

Current diagnostic tests for guiding therapy are notoriously slow and costly. They often depend on intricate centralized facilities that can take over three weeks to deliver results, which is downright unacceptable when lives hang in the balance. Signatur recognizes that many patients—especially in underserved areas—don't have access to timely, affordable diagnostic tools. 

**The Solution: Smarter PCR Kits**

At its core, Signatur Biosciences leverages its innovative **PCRchitectur** technology to streamline and enhance the diagnostic process. Instead of traditional PCR tests that are limited by their need for expensive machinery and lengthy procedures, Signatur's smart PCR kits can be run on standard qPCR machines found in local hospital labs. 

This means a significant reduction in turnaround time from weeks to mere days, enabling faster decision-making in treatment paths. No longer do clinicians have to sift through complex workflows or rely on numerous tests. Signatur’s kits consolidate the work of detecting and interpreting multiple RNA biomarkers into a single test, making the process more efficient and cost-effective.

**A Bigger Vision**

Signatur Biosciences doesn't just see itself as a player in breast cancer prognosis; its ambition is to expand the scope of PCR testing to cover a wider range of diseases, paving the way for smarter healthcare solutions that are both affordable and accessible globally.

In summary, by making precision diagnostics accessible and efficient, Signatur Biosciences stands at the forefront of modern healthcare innovation, potentially reshaping how we think about disease detection and management.

- **Reduce Admin Work**: Their clients report significant decreases in operational costs and administrative workload.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S22,,,"Sunlight is an API to change the card-on-file with apps and subscription services. Fintechs use Sunlight to automatically make their cards top-of-wallet as soon as they're issued. 

Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. 

In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Until Sunlight.

With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.

The Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more…), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number and CVV code right on the first try!",2021.0,"[{'name': 'Guy Ziv, Founder', 'description': 'Guy Ziv is the Co-Founder and CEO of Sunlight, a seasoned business executive, and entrepreneur with a wealth of experience in introducing disruptive technologies to medium and large financial institutions worldwide.

Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S22, Sunlight is revolutionizing the way consumers manage their payment methods. At its core, Sunlight is an API crafted to simplify the process of updating card-on-file information across various platforms—from Netflix to Starbucks—without leaving the app. 

### Why Sunlight Matters

The payment landscape is evolving. In 2021, a staggering 79% of consumers had at least one card saved with an online service. For banks and fintechs, this shift has created a new challenge: when customers switch banks or issue new cards, they face the daunting task of updating their payment details everywhere they shop. Without an efficient way to do so, card issuers often struggle with low conversion rates and lost revenue opportunities.

That's where Sunlight comes in. By offering a universal Card-On-File API, financial institutions (FIs) can provide their users with an easy solution to keep their payment information up-to-date. Imagine a world where switching to a new debit or credit card is as seamless as a quick tap on a button. That’s the future Sunlight is building.

### How It Works

Sunlight allows users to select their vendors directly within the app of their financial institution, enabling them to update card details across the board effortlessly. The API is integrated with major platforms—think Uber, Amazon, DoorDash—making it a versatile tool for any business with a card-on-file model. This integration ensures the card number and CVV code are entered correctly every time, significantly reducing friction in the payment process.

### What Can Sunlight Do for You?

1. **Increased Share of Wallet**: Sunlight empowers users to set your card as their preferred payment method across various vendors, effectively increasing your transaction volume.
   
2. **Streamlined Customer Experience**: For your customers, this means fewer hurdles when managing their recurring transactions, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

3. **Enhanced Revenue Opportunities**: With more transactions routed through your card, you'll see a boost in interchange revenue, offering an advantage in the competitive corporate card market.

4. **Security and Privacy First**: Data protection is non-negotiable. Sunlight adheres to the highest standards of security and privacy, ensuring that user information is safeguarded at all times.

### Why Choose Sunlight?

With just a small team of six based in New York, Sunlight is already making waves in the fintech sector. Their innovative solution enables merchants and service providers to enhance their payment offerings while providing a crucial service to consumers. Whether you're a financial institution looking to enhance your card offerings or a consumer who values simplicity, Sunlight is driving the change you need.

Founded in 2022 and based in San Jose, California, Sunpia is revolutionizing the serverless infrastructure landscape. The company emerged from Y Combinator’s Summer 2022 batch, emphasizing a straightforward mission: to allow developers to deploy serverless applications without the burden of rewriting existing code.

**How It Works**

Instead of starting from scratch, developers can simply annotate their code. Sunpia takes care of the heavy lifting by automatically crafting a microservice version of that code, ready for deployment on the developer's own cloud environment. This approach not only saves time but also leverages the cost and performance advantages of serverless architecture.

**Key Features**

- **Vendor Agnostic:** Sunpia ensures that developers aren’t tied to a single cloud provider, supporting a more flexible deployment strategy.
  
- **High Redundancy:** In the event of a cloud provider outage, whether it's AWS, Azure, GCP, or IBM, Sunpia helps keep services running smoothly for customers.
  
- **Simplified Serverless Architecture:** Developers can sidestep the complexity often associated with serverless services. Sunpia automatically provides an optimized architecture tailored for any cloud environment.

**Current Status and Team**

Sunpia operates with a compact team of three employees, including Group Partner Brad Flora, and is tagged in the realms of developer tools, Kubernetes, and data engineering within the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area ecosystem.

This reflects not only satisfaction but also trust from the teams using this platform.

Yo and Misato have previously built a retail-tech company together and sold it for $20M to Rakuten. Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari.
Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.

**The Problem**
In today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up.

Their monolithic architecture makes it difficult for developers to tailor to the specific needs, even though that's what the enterprises want for ERP. 

At the same time, legacy ERPs struggle to work well with the variety of cloud-based tools that modern businesses rely on.

Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.

Building on these challenges, users of old ERP systems often face:
* Hard-to-Use Interfaces: The screens and menus are old school... confusing, slowing down your work.
* Wrong Set of Features: Too many unnecessary options for you and not enough of what you actually need.
* Lack of Transparency: It's tough to understand what's happening behind the scenes.
* High Cost: The expense of maintaining these systems eats into your budget.

**The Solution**

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

What does it mean to our clients?

### Overview
Tailor is transforming the landscape of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) with its highly customizable headless platform. Founded in 2021 and based in Tokyo, Japan, Tailor emerged from Y Combinator's Batch S22 as the first fully Japan-based startup in the accelerator's history.

### The Founders
The driving force behind Tailor, Yo and Misato, aren't new to the entrepreneurship scene. They previously co-founded a retail-tech venture that was acquired by Rakuten for a cool $20 million. Yo is a seasoned entrepreneur with three successful exits under his belt, boasting experience from McKinsey. Misato brings a wealth of knowledge from her tenure as head of R&D at Mercari. Together, they combine deep industry insight with a knack for building successful tech solutions.

### The Problem: Legacy ERPs
In a world where speed and adaptability are paramount, traditional ERP systems simply fall short. Their rigid monolithic architecture is a significant barrier, making it challenging for businesses to customize and integrate the systems with various cloud-based tools. Using outdated ERPs, companies are often bogged down by:
- Clunky interfaces that frustrate users.
- Feature sets that miss the mark—overloaded with unnecessary tools but lacking essential functionalities.
- A lack of transparency that complicates issue resolution.
- Exorbitant costs which strain budgets and resources.

### The Solution: A Headless ERP
Enter Tailor's headless ERP model, which allows clients to easily customize the frontend while maintaining a powerful backend. This API-first approach ensures seamless integration with existing systems, enabling businesses to rapidly evolve without the need for extensive overhauls. 

Here’s what Tailor offers:
- **Faster Development**: Custom applications can be developed in days instead of months, thanks to an intuitive customizable platform.
- **Reduced Maintenance Costs**: A well-documented backend and API framework mean less time and money spent on upkeep.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - GraphQL endpoints for flexible frontend customization.
  - Templates for complex business logic tailored to large enterprises.
  - Workflow management that aligns with specific business processes.
  - A directory service to mirror intricate organizational structures.

### Why Tailor Stands Out
Tailor is built to respond to the complexities of modern enterprises without the headaches of yesteryear's systems. Its commitment to customization aligns perfectly with the needs of businesses looking to streamline operations and accelerate innovation. Importantly, Tailor isn’t just flexible; it’s also secure, with SOC2 certification ensuring that sensitive enterprise data is protected.

### Get Involved
For those ready to ditch their outdated ERP systems and embrace the future, Tailor makes it easy to start customizing an ERP that actually fits your business model. Their platform supports various use cases, making it easier to adapt as your needs change.

With a small but mighty team of three, they’re leveraging AI to streamline the chaos.

The core mission at Trebu is simple yet impactful. They extract and organize order requests and supplier availabilities from the sea of WhatsApp messages and emails that inundate logistics brokers.

This means that adopting Trebu is refreshingly straightforward; companies can begin reaping the benefits in days, not weeks or months.

Beyond just improving order accuracy, Trebu brings clarity and visibility to operations, reducing human errors and enhancing the overall efficiency of logistics processes. Whether you’re a small startup or a large corporation, Trebu is scalable and customizable to meet your needs. Plus, dedicated technical support is always a click away, ensuring users maximize their experience.

Curious about how it works? Trebu utilizes AI to transform unstructured messages into actionable data, so logistics professionals can focus on what truly matters—driving business forward.

Founded in 2022 and nestled in the bustling city of Singapore, Uwi is on a mission to tackle the housing backlog in Southeast Asia. With their flagship product, the Express Building (EB) loan program, Uwi provides financing solutions tailored for small and medium-sized residential developers in Indonesia and the Philippines. This innovative approach not only aims to ease the burden on the housing market but also to empower developers to scale their affordable housing projects effectively.

Uwi operates in an intricate space that blends fintech with real estate, categorized under various tags like B2B and PropTech. It's worth noting that Uwi is part of Y Combinator’s Batch S22, which speaks volumes about their potential and backing. Their small but mighty team of 14, led by Group Partner Brad Flora, is steadfastly working to refine their approach to financing.

### How It Works

Uwi's Express Building loan is essentially a short-term bridge loan designed to cover the gap between the issuance of official building permits (NOA/LOG) and the eventual bank home loan take-out. Here’s a quick breakdown of the process:
1. **Submission of Business Documents**: Developers kick off by submitting necessary paperwork.
2. **Approval & Post-Approval Requirements**: Once approved, they’ll need to meet additional criteria.
3. **Receive Funds**: Funds are disbursed to the developer.

The EB loan covers 100% of the approved construction budget, with interest-only monthly payments until the principal is repaid at maturity. An important aspect is the flexibility offered with a possible extension of up to 60 days—no prepayment penalties make it even more appealing.

### Current Focus

Uwi is currently laser-focused on Indonesia and the Philippines, two vibrant markets with pressing housing needs. With their innovative financing solutions, they are looking to be a significant player in addressing this shortage.

If you're a developer in the region and looking for a partner that understands both the intricacies of financing and the housing landscape, Uwi might just be the right fit for you.

Founded in 2021 and a proud member of Y Combinator Batch S22, Velontra is on a bold mission: to build a hypersonic space plane that can take off from virtually anywhere and in any weather conditions, revolutionizing how we think about launching payloads into space. Their innovative horizontal takeoff design enhances launch reliability and provides customers direct access to any orbit.

### What Sets Velontra Apart

At the heart of Velontra's technology is an air-breathing propulsion system that boasts fuel efficiency up to six times greater than traditional rockets, using atmospheric oxygen to boost payload capacity significantly. This makes Velontra not just another rocket company; it’s a game-changer in the aerospace industry.

With millions in existing government and commercial contracts, Velontra is making strides in a sector ripe for disruption. Their team, consisting of industry veterans, former senior government executives, and even a NASA astronaut, brings a wealth of expertise to the table.

### How Does It Work?

The hypersonic space plane takes off using a jet propulsion system, climbs to over 100,000 feet, achieving speeds of Mach 5, and then seamlessly launches a second-stage rocket into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This process allows Velontra to maintain low costs while providing rapid deployment capabilities—transforming space access into an on-demand service.

### Economic Advantage

Compared to existing launch providers, which typically charge around $62 million per launch and require a lead time of up to nine months, Velontra offers a more economical solution. They are aiming for cost reductions of up to 90% and lead times of less than one week, positioning themselves as the fastest and most affordable option in the market.

### The Team Behind Velontra

With a dedicated team of five employees based in Cincinnati, OH, Velontra is led by experts like Eric Briggs, COO, formerly Head of Engines at Virgin Orbit; and Joel Darin, CEO/CTO, a pioneer in hypersonic technology. Their combined experience provides a solid foundation for the company's ambitious goals.

### Looking Ahead

Velontra’s vision extends beyond just launching satellites—it’s about building a future where access to space is quicker, cheaper, and more flexible than ever before. By embracing innovative technologies and a robust business model, Velontra is truly “boldly going where no one has gone before.”

Founded in 2022 and now a proud member of Y Combinator's Batch S22, Voltic is on a mission to revolutionize the shipping industry by developing electric cargo ships powered predominantly by solar energy. The company has its eyes set on a significant goal: to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with shipping, aiming to eliminate 2.2% of global CO2 emissions, alongside reducing costs by an impressive 50-75%, depending on the route.

### What Makes Voltic Stand Out?

1. **Eco-Friendly Innovation**: Voltic's electric cargo ships are designed to be both environmentally friendly and economically viable. This approach places them at the forefront of the industry’s push towards decarbonization, especially as new EU and IMO regulations come into play in the coming years. Their ships are expected not only to meet but exceed the reliability standards of traditional vessels, featuring backup diesel systems for safety.

2. **High-Impact Solutions**: The numbers speak for themselves. Alongside the reduction of CO2 emissions, Voltic's technology promises to cut down 15% of global NOx and 13% of SOx emissions—making significant strides in combatting air pollution.

3. **Global Reach**: Voltic offers a variety of coastal and trans-oceanic routes, catering to requests from freight forwarders and cargo owners. Key routes include Asia to Los Angeles, Asia to Europe, and various inter-Asia connections. This positions Voltic well to become a preferred choice for shippers around the world.

4. **Speed Without Compromise**: One common misconception about transitioning to greener transportation options is the need to compromise on speed. Voltic debunks this myth, ensuring their zero-emission ships maintain the same transit times that shippers are accustomed to.

### The Team and Support

Operating with a lean team of five based in Cambridge, MA, Voltic is backed by Harj Taggar, their Group Partner from Y Combinator. Their small size suggests agility and close-knit collaboration, essential for innovating rapidly in a competitive space.

### The Bigger Picture

As global shipping continues to grapple with its impact on climate change, Voltic stands as a beacon of hope and a model for what future shipping might look like.

**Founded**: 2023  
**Location**: Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel  
**Team**: 2 employees  
**Y Combinator Batch**: S22  
**Website**: [wandsolar.com](https://www.wandsolar.com)

Wand Solar is on a mission to help landlords monetize their solar investments by allowing them to sell solar energy directly to their tenants. The idea here is simple but powerful: by streamlining the solar billing process, Wand Solar transforms what can often be a complicated venture into a straightforward, income-generating opportunity for real estate property owners.

#### The Concept

At its core, Wand Solar offers a platform that enables landlords of single-family and multi-family properties to easily integrate solar energy into their rental offerings. This approach not only adds a new revenue stream but also cultivates a more eco-conscious environment for tenants. By leveraging existing solar installations (or facilitating new ones), Wand Solar ensures that landlords can earn from the energy produced while keeping their tenants happy with potentially lower energy bills.

In a world where climate tech is becoming increasingly vital, Wand Solar positions itself within the broader context of real estate sustainability. The tagging of the company across categories like ""solar-power,"" ""real-estate,"" and ""climate"" reinforces its commitment to innovation in the renewable energy space.

#### How It Works

1. **Connection**: Landlords can connect their properties to the Wand Solar system without needing extra hardware. The platform smartly tracks tenant energy consumption to help landlords accurately bill them for solar energy used.
   
2. **Billing**: Wand Solar manages billing by generating a single, clear invoice that encompasses both energy sourced from the electricity provider and the solar panels installed.

3. **Earnings**: This billing structure ensures that landlords can enjoy a consistent income from their solar investments while promoting fair practices—every tenant pays only for what they use.

By charging just a 10% fee on the bill charged to tenants for their solar energy use, Wand Solar maintains transparency while still incentivizing landlords to embrace the solar option.

#### Impacting the Community

Beyond the financial benefits, Wand Solar aims to create a community of rental owners who are invested in advancing solar energy adoption. They’ve particularly stood by the Californian solar industry amid recent policy changes, showcasing their commitment to supporting the broader solar landscape.

Testimonials from landlords reveal real impacts: increased cap rates, monthly income boosts, and attracting eco-conscious tenants. It’s a win-win scenario—more income for landlords and a step toward reducing carbon footprints for tenants.

If you’re a landlord looking to blend your rental business with innovative climate tech, Wand Solar is your partner in solar success. You can explore this opportunity further by visiting their website or scheduling a call for personalized guidance.

### Summary

Wand Solar is not just about solar panels; it’s about transforming properties into sustainable income sources. With straightforward billing and support for landlords, they statistically make the adoption of solar energy a no-brainer.
