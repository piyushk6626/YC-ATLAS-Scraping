Founded in 2013, Literably is a pioneering education technology company headquartered in San Francisco and part of Y Combinator Batch IK12. With a compact team of 10, Literably's mission is to enhance early literacy assessment for elementary schools through innovative software that streamlines the testing process for K-8 students.

**What They're Doing:**

Literably's platform allows teachers to assess reading skills efficiently using their mobile and web applications. Instead of spending countless hours on manual testing, educators can now administer assessments online, turning what used to be a lengthy process into a streamlined operation where results are available within 24 hours. This not only saves teachers precious instructional time but also helps them focus on teaching rather than testing.

The products offered by Literably range from the **Universal Literacy Screener**, which identifies students at risk for reading difficulties (including dyslexia), to assessments focusing on phonological awareness, phonics, oral reading fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, and more. Importantly, their tools can assess students in Spanish as well, broadening access to literacy support for diverse populations.

**Recent Developments:**

In a significant milestone, Literably recently joined forces with Heggerty, aiming to provide seamless, science-based literacy assessment to thousands of schools across the U.S. This acquisition is set to amplify their impact in the early education landscape, allowing for greater integration of their assessments in instructional practices.

**Why Literably Stands Out:**

1. **Time-Saving for Educators:** Teachers can implement assessments either independently by students or directly alongside them, ensuring a shorter turnaround for results without compromising instructional time.
   
2. **Data-Driven Insights:** Literably provides intuitive reports that allow educators and administrators to customize interventions based on individual student needs, thereby creating targeted learning experiences to foster growth.

3. **Rigorous Research Backing:** Their assessments were developed with R&D funding from the U.S. Department of Education, and are undergoing validation studies to continually improve their efficacy.

**In Conclusion:**

Literably embodies the future of literacy education through technology. By simplifying assessments and providing actionable insights, it helps educators make data-informed decisions that directly affect student outcomes. Whether you’re a teacher looking to minimize assessment time or an administrator aiming for comprehensive reporting, Literably is carving a notable path in the educational landscape.

Rumie innovates with technology to lower the cost of learning resources. We find and organize the best free learning content online on the LearnCloud, and deliver libraries of it to offline communities on low-cost tablets. 

Our vision is to lead a movement of people working to make education affordable. Join us!",,[],"**The Rumie Initiative: Transforming Education Through Technology**

The Rumie Initiative is a non-profit organization based in Toronto, Canada, focused on tackling a pressing global issue: over one billion children lack access to quality education. Founded as a tech startup and part of Y Combinator Batch IK12, Rumie is on a mission to bridge the educational gap for those communities that are most in need but least likely to access free learning content.

### The Mission and Vision

Rumie's mission is straightforward yet profound: to harness the vast reservoir of free learning content available online and make it accessible to the underserved. They’ve innovated a solution utilizing technology that significantly lowers the cost of educational resources. Instead of traditional online learning, they deliver libraries of curated content—called the LearnCloud—on low-cost tablets to offline communities. Their vision is not just to educate but to lead a movement that makes education affordable and accessible for everyone. 

### How It Works

Through a platform that organizes and curates learning materials, Rumie has created a wealth of resources called ""Bytes."" These are compact, bite-sized modules designed for efficient learning. The beauty of Bytes lies in their ability to cover a topic in just minutes, making learning easily digestible and incredibly efficient—20% more so than conventional methods. Whether it’s personal finance, mental health, or job preparedness, Bytes target skills that people actively want to learn or improve.

### Join the Movement

With a small but dedicated team of 11 employees, Rumie is inviting everyone to join their cause. They believe that education isn't just about learning—it's about empowerment, opportunity, and breaking barriers that prevent growth. If you're passionate about education and technology and want to be part of a change-making initiative, there’s a spot for you here. 

In a world where education should be a right, not a privilege, The Rumie Initiative stands out as a beacon of hope and innovation, proving that with the right tools, anyone can learn—anywhere.
