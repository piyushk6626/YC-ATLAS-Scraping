,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S18,,,,2018.0,[],"Dorian Therapeutics is an innovative biotech company nestled in San Carlos, California, which is on a mission to tackle aging and age-related diseases. Founded in 2018 and a proud member of Y Combinator’s Summer 2018 batch, they’re a small but ambitious team of eight.

So what’s their big idea? They’re pioneering a new class of therapeutics known as **senoblockers**. This cutting-edge technology aims to rejuvenate tissues by addressing one fundamental issue that underlies many diseases: aging. With roots in patented research from Stanford University, Dorian is working on a solution that has the potential to reverse the harmful effects of aging at the cellular level.

The science speaks to a pressing issue—aging leads to decreased stem cell activity and an accumulation of senescent cells, which can wreak havoc on our bodies. Dorian's senoblockers target these processes, aiming to rejuvenate our biological systems by restoring cellular function and enhancing regeneration.

Their approach is direct: by understanding and manipulating the biology of aging, they believe they can not only extend lifespan but also improve the quality of life as we age. This is summed up nicely in their motto—""Younger, for longer.""

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S18,,,,2016.0,[],"Enveritas is a New York-based organization that focuses on ensuring ethical practices within global supply chains, particularly pertaining to sustainability in the coffee industry. Founded in 2016 and backed by Y Combinator’s Summer 2018 batch, Enveritas has grown to a team of 60 dedicated employees. Their mission is to tackle critical issues like child slavery and environmental degradation by providing thorough verification of coffee farms worldwide.

What sets Enveritas apart is their innovative approach to sustainability assurance. They aim to help smallholder coffee farmers by eliminating fees for them, meaning that the coffee roasters actually pay for the assessment process. This inclusivity allows more farmers—regardless of their farm's size or location—to access sustainable export markets.

Their methodology includes utilizing advanced geospatial analytics and satellite imagery to monitor farm practices, thereby ensuring that they meet high environmental and social standards. In 2022, Enveritas plans to visit 50,000 farms across over 20 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, assessing their social, economic, and environmental practices.

To receive a responsible sourcing claim from Enveritas, coffee companies must undergo an independent annual assessment, address identified issues in alignment with their purchases, and evaluate their efforts to create real impact. This tiered approach not only fosters accountability but also provides actionable insights for supply chain participants and policymakers.

So, if you're looking to understand how sustainability and ethics can be integrated into the global supply chain—particularly in coffee production—Enveritas is a fascinating example of this growing movement.

### Mission
Helicarrier aims to reconnect Africa with the global economy through better financial services.

They believe that adopting digital currencies is the way forward in creating a more open financial system.

### Recent Developments

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S18,,,,,[],"**Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, PBC: An Overview**

The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company (often shortened to Cost Plus Drugs) is on a mission to revolutionize access to medications by making high-cost generic drugs affordable. Founded by billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, this online pharmacy aims to eliminate the price-markup tactics of traditional pharmacies by operating transparently and directly with manufacturers.

### Mission and Operations

Cost Plus Drugs is focused on creating low-cost versions of expensive generic drugs. The company operates through its website, [costplusdrugs.com](http://www.costplusdrugs.com), where it lists hundreds of medications, many of which are essential for managing chronic conditions and improving overall health. The goal is simple: “Everyone should have safe, affordable medicines with transparent prices,” Cuban emphasizes. 

### How It Works

Here's how it works:

1. **Find Your Medication**: Patients can browse or search for their required medication on the website.
2. **Get a Prescription**: Users must reach out to their healthcare providers to send prescriptions directly to Cost Plus Drugs.
3. **Receive Your Medications**: Once received, prescriptions are processed, and medications are shipped to the customer's home.

By negotiating directly with manufacturers, Cost Plus Drugs can offer medications at prices significantly lower than retail rates. For example, Abiraterone Acetate, a generic for Zytiga, costs $23.69 on their site compared to a retail price of $1,093.20. This kind of savings speaks volumes about the company's commitment to affordability.

### Transparency in Pricing

The company prides itself on its transparent pricing model, which breaks down costs for customers so they can understand exactly what they’re paying for. There are no hidden markups, and patients can see a clear cost structure including manufacturer prices, a small markup, and shipping fees.

### A Public Benefit Corporation

Cost Plus Drugs is structured as a public-benefit corporation (PBC). This means it has a social mission at its core—a commitment to improving public health and making sure more people can afford their medication without going bankrupt. Cuban’s involvement adds significant visibility, as he is well-known for challenging the status quo in various industries.

### Headlines and Impact

Since its inception, the company has made waves in the press, highlighting the struggle many Americans face regarding prescription drug prices. It stands at the intersection of healthcare and e-commerce, and has been noted as a potential solution in government discussions about lowering drug costs on a national scale.

### Conclusion

The 50M SMBs in India account for 40% of the nation’s GDP. As much as 60% of their sales happen on credit. That’s ~24% of the country’s GDP (500B$) lying on paper!

OKCREDIT as a company came into existence to start solving the most important problem of credit recovery in MSMEs. We as first movers developed a bookkeeping app that would help any merchant sitting at the remotest corner of the country with internet connectivity to record his transactions digitally. We helped them track the credit given to their customers and suppliers. With our Okcredit app a merchant can track the amount of credit given, monitor credit limit, send reminders and eventually can collect faster from their customers. So as a company our vision was to bring the data dark merchants onto the digital platform. We have changed the way the MSMEs record the transactions and eased their life today.",2017.0,[],"**OkCredit: Simplifying Credit Management for Indian SMBs**

Founded in 2017 and based in Bengaluru, OkCredit is on a mission to revolutionize bookkeeping for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in India. The company emerged to tackle a critical issue that impacts around 50 million SMBs, which account for 40% of India’s GDP. The challenge? A cumbersome manual process of managing informal credit that wastes countless hours on tracking and collecting dues.

In India, around 60% of sales occur on credit, translating to about $500 billion of the economy tied up in informal transactions. This is where OkCredit steps in, offering an innovative digital ledger application that puts credit management right at the fingertips of merchants—no matter where they are in the country.

### How It Works:

The OkCredit app allows users to digitally record transactions, seamlessly tracking the credit extended to customers and suppliers. Once a merchant sets up their account—something that’s as easy as downloading the app—they can monitor amounts owed, set credit limits, send payment reminders via SMS or WhatsApp, and streamline recovery processes. This makes it an essential tool for any merchant looking to bring their bookkeeping into the digital age without the stress of traditional ledgers.

### Features:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive, even for individuals not well-versed in tech.
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Available in 11 local languages, ensuring inclusivity across diverse merchants in the country.
- **Secure and Reliable**: Data safety is paramount, with automatic backups to safeguard information.
- **Free to Use**: There's no monthly fee, making it accessible to all business owners.
- **Integrated Collection Reminders**: Automated notifications enhance the chances of timely repayments.

### Growth and Impact:

With just a team of 70 passionate professionals, OkCredit is making waves across 2,800 cities in India. They’re not just helping merchants digitize their bookkeeping; they are democratizing access to credit management tools, allowing even the smallest businesses to modernize their operations.

### The Founders:

OkCredit was co-founded by Harsh Pokharna (CEO), Aditya Prasad (CTO), and Gaurav Kumar (CPO). Their journey began in the Y Combinator Batch S18, and they have since built a company that deeply understands the stakes and struggles of MSMEs in India.

### Why It Matters:

Founded in 2018 and based in Houston, Texas, Paladin Drones is a groundbreaking company that is reshaping how emergency services respond to critical situations. As part of Y Combinator's Batch S18, Paladin Drones harnesses the power of autonomous drones to aid first responders when a 911 call is made. The immediate dispatch of a drone allows for live video feeds sent back to responders, giving them crucial situational details, like the size and exact location of a fire. 

Here’s what makes Paladin stand out:

- **Mission-Driven**: Paladin's mission is clear: to deploy drones that enhance situational awareness for first responders, helping them operate more effectively and save lives.

- **Impressive Metrics**: On average, drones are en route to emergency scenes within 90 seconds of a 911 call. Each client can manage over 670 emergency calls, logging upwards of 30,000 miles collectively. 

- **Comprehensive Offerings**: The company offers a suite of products designed around public safety, including:
  - **DJI Dock** for autonomous or manual deployment and recharging.
  - **Paladin EXT** to enable LTE cellular service, extending the range and reliability of operations.
  - **Watchtower**, a centralized command platform for real-time video sharing and automated flight reporting.

- **Market Enforcement**: The company operates in the 'saas', 'drones', and 'govtech' sectors and maintains a lean team of about 12 dedicated employees.

- **Community Impact**: Paladin Drones has flown over 20,000 flights across the country. Departments that have implemented their Drone as First Responder (DFR) program have reported enhanced operational efficiency, better safety measures, and improved responsiveness, vital for public safety and community trust.

- **Future Partnerships**: Their collaboration with T-Mobile for Government is expected to provide extended operational ranges, allowing drones to go beyond the limitations of traditional radio frequencies. 

As emergency response continues to evolve with technological advancements, Paladin Drones is positioned at the forefront, demonstrating that when seconds count, having aerial eyes and ears can make all the difference.

Our mission is to keep senior living residents healthy—by keeping them away from hospitals where exposure to health risks is high. Through our new clinical care delivery model, we bring clinicians right into senior living communities, providing safer, more convenient primary care. Pine Park partners with senior living communities to provide primary care to their residents, building a value-based care model where we keep patients healthier. This allows us to provide comprehensive healthcare on-site, see patients regularly, and better support their holistic health.",2018.0,[],"**Pine Park Health: Revolutionizing Senior Care**

Pine Park Health is a unique primary care provider founded in 2018, a brainchild of the Y Combinator Batch S18. Their mission is refreshingly straightforward: keep residents of senior living communities healthy and out of hospitals. By embedding clinical care directly into these communities, they minimize exposure to health risks. This approach turns traditional healthcare on its head, offering convenience, personal attention, and a more supportive environment for seniors.

### What They Do
Pine Park Health provides on-site primary care tailored specifically for older adults. Imagine having a dedicated healthcare professional come to your home or community regularly. This model not only limits the stress that comes from hospital visits but also emphasizes continuous care—keeping an eye on everything from diabetes to dementia.

The healthcare team, made up of 75 skilled employees based in Oakland, CA, collaborates closely with senior living staff to deliver a holistic healthcare experience. They offer a full suite of services: preventive care, chronic condition management, and even diagnostic testing—all aimed at making seniors feel their best without the hassle of traditional doctor’s office visits.

### How It Works
In practical terms: there are no extra fees for signing up, and they accept many forms of insurance, including Medicare and Medicare Advantage. This means that getting care doesn’t have to come with a financial burden—a refreshing change in an often convoluted healthcare landscape. 

In addition, Pine Park Health prioritizes rapid care. Their clinical support line is available 24/7—a reassuring safety net for any urgent health concerns, whether late at night or on weekends. 

### What's Unique
What sets Pine Park apart is not just in-home visits but also the intention behind these interactions. They seek to build relationships, understand patients deeply, and foster an environment where healthcare feels personalized rather than transactional. 

This embedded approach in the community translates into regular health programming and collaboration with Assisted Living or Memory Care staff as well, which helps promote overall quality of life.

### In Summary
Pine Park Health is redefining what primary care looks like for seniors. By taking healthcare where seniors live, they eliminate the barriers that often prevent older adults from receiving the care they need. The philosophy here is clear: deliver personalized, compassionate care that fits seamlessly into the lives of seniors, helping them thrive in their communities.

So, what does that mean? In essence, Rejuvenation Technologies has developed a method to deliver TERT mRNA, a process that can significantly extend telomeres—structures at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with age. This shortening is a major contributor to the aging process, so reversing a decade's worth of telomere shortening in just a few days is a remarkable feat. Their goal is to take these promising therapies from the lab to clinical settings, moving closer to tangible solutions that could redefine aging.

Headquartered in Mountain View, California, their compact team of two is led by an experienced group with strong ties to the San Francisco Bay Area's vibrant tech and biotech scene. Their work falls under the exciting umbrellas of anti-aging, gene therapy, and nanomedicine—fields that are rich with potential but also require clever navigation to succeed.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S18,,,"Shelf Engine helps businesses increase sales by accurately predicting the perfect amount of perishable goods to order, thus reducing food waste.",2016.0,[],"**Shelf Engine: Revolutionizing Grocery Supply Chains**

Founded in 2016 and hailing from Seattle, WA, Shelf Engine is on a mission to transform how grocery stores manage their highly perishable inventory. The company aims to minimize food waste by leveraging machine learning to predict the optimal quantity of perishable goods each store should order. They believe that with better data, grocery retailers can reduce waste and enhance their bottom line. 

As part of the Y Combinator S18 batch, Shelf Engine comes equipped with the fine-tuned capabilities of a tech startup that’s serious about solving a significant problem: over 40% of deli sandwiches and a staggering 35% of bread go to waste due to poor inventory management. Their AI-driven solutions not only streamline this ordering process but also free up valuable employee time to focus more on customer service rather than spend it wrestling with inventory forecasts.

With a team of 40 talented individuals, Shelf Engine has developed an intelligent forecasting system that factors in daily sales data, local events, and even weather patterns. This ensures that each product ordered is as close to perfect as it can get, thus minimizing stockouts and maximizing sales opportunities. Their approach doesn’t just boost retail efficiency—it’s also a win for consumers who benefit from fresher, better-stocked shelves.

Under the leadership of co-founder and CEO Stefan Kalb, the company is backed by partners like Nan and a strong strategy team. Together, they operate on the firm belief that reducing food waste is not just good business; it’s essential for our environment.

These fiber-rich parts of crops are hugely abundant and donât typically make their way into the food system.",2017.0,[],"### The Supplant Company: Revolutionizing Sugar from Fiber

Founded in 2017 and hailing from Cambridge, UK, The Supplant Company is on a mission to redefine how we think about sugar. Their innovative approach focuses on creating unique sugars derived entirely from plant fiber, thus carving out a new category in the food ingredient market. By upcycling agricultural by-products like corn cobs, wheat straw, and oat hulls—parts of crops that typically go to waste—they’re not only developing healthier sugar alternatives but also making strides toward sustainability.

### What’s Unique?

Supplant™ sugars are lower in calories, boast a reduced glycemic response compared to traditional glucose, and provide prebiotic benefits. The brilliance of their product lies in its ability to mimic the taste and texture of conventional sugars in our favorite treats without the associated health risks. This means you can have your chocolate cake and eat it too—guilt-free. As Chef Thomas Keller puts it, Supplant enables the creation of desserts just as delightful as those made with traditional sugar.

### The Vision

The Supplant Company's ethos revolves around a radical reevaluation of food systems. They see the missed potential in what they call “The Forgotten Half of the Harvest.” By focusing on what’s often discarded, they not only promote a healthier diet but also contribute to better climate outcomes and food security.

Their team consists of 15 passionate employees, and they have been nurtured by Y Combinator in Batch S18, positioning them uniquely in the food-tech and sustainable agriculture sectors. They are guided by a philosophy that emphasizes sustainability without sacrificing taste—an approach that resonates deeply with today’s health-conscious consumers.

### Why It Matters

In a world where the health implications of consuming high glycemic index sugars are becoming increasingly recognized, The Supplant Company is addressing an essential need. Their innovative products allow us to enjoy sweetness without the weighty consequences on our health or the planet.
