At the heart of their offering is Agave Sync, a product designed to keep financial data seamlessly in sync between contractors working in the field and their back-office accounting teams. This is crucial because, in an industry often siloed by standalone applications, Agave bridges the gap, ensuring that everyone—from the site manager to the accountant—has access to the same current data. 

Agave's roots trace back to Y Combinator's W22 batch, highlighting its innovative potential. The company has built a compact but effective team of 20 employees, orchestrated under the guidance of notable partner Harj Taggar. 

Currently, Agave is on the lookout for talent across engineering, product, and sales roles as it scales—indicative of its growth phase. Their offerings include pricing plans for contractors and a library of useful use cases, demonstrating a customer-centric approach.

Their mission is straightforward yet crucial: to build systems for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at an industrial scale, a necessary step in combating climate change.

The team at AirMyne, currently numbering 11, consists of engineers, scientists, and dedicated problem-solvers who are committed to developing effective and efficient solutions in carbon capture technology. They emphasize a practical approach to Direct Air Capture (DAC), aiming to address the typical hurdles this technology faces as it scales. 

What sets AirMyne apart? For one, their process is energy efficient, leveraging low-temperature heat—often sourced from waste steam from industrial processes or geothermal energy. This scalability is reinforced by the use of inexpensive and readily available materials in their systems, which are designed with simplicity and safety in mind.

AirMyne’s team brings considerable industrial expertise, having already made strides in successful climate solutions; they understand what’s required to tackle these challenges head-on. They maintain a ""climate-first"" stance, advocating for genuine decarbonization rather than using DAC as a crutch for ongoing fossil fuel extraction.

Importantly, AirMyne prides itself on its humility and realistic expectations. They don’t promise more than their technology can deliver, and their claims are grounded in rigorous data. This sensible approach extends to their rapid prototyping and experimentation ethos—essentially learning and iterating quickly to refine their methods.

As they look to the future, AirMyne is eager to expand their network, inviting partners, investors, and advisors who share their vision of transparency in Direct Air Capture technology.

Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, Alga Biosciences is a Berkeley, CA-based startup on a mission to revolutionize agriculture by reducing methane emissions from cattle. Their bold claim? ""We stop cows from burping methane."" 

Alga's innovative approach uses algae-based feed supplements that can reduce methane emissions from cattle by up to *97%*. Given that ruminants like cows account for a significant chunk of annual methane emissions in the U.S. (27%), this is not just a minor improvement; it’s a considerable step toward addressing climate change.

### The Science Behind It

Methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas that is 104 times more potent than CO2 over a decade. By curbing these emissions, Alga aims to slow down global warming significantly. Their feed additive is claimed to be safe, effective, and inexpensive, making it not only an eco-friendly solution but also a cost-effective option for cattle owners. 

By incorporating just 0.5% of this supplement into the cattle's diet, each cow's methane output can be cut dramatically—equivalent to emissions from driving a car for 12,000 miles! With over 100 million cows in the U.S. alone, the potential impact is staggering.

### Financial Incentives

Less methane also means more efficient growth for cattle. When cows expend less energy on methane production, they require less feed to reach their optimal weight, creating financial savings for ranchers. This dual benefit of financial gain and environmental impact makes Alga's solution particularly attractive.

### Team and Backing

Alga is led by a compact team of 6 and is backed by significant venture capital, including partnerships with funds like Collab Fund and Y Combinator. This robust backing enables them to focus on scientific research and innovation in the agri-tech sector.

### Conclusion

Alga Biosciences stands at an exciting intersection of biotechnology and climate action. By addressing a major source of greenhouse gases, they’re not just feeding cattle—they’re feeding hope for a sustainable future.

**What is Amal Invest?**
Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch W22, Amal Invest is a savvy fintech venture based in Manama, Bahrain. At its core, it's an investment app designed to cater to Muslims who want to ensure their investments are Shariah-compliant. Given the complexity involved in identifying suitable investment options, Amal has simplified this uphill task by filtering through extensive data to help users make informed decisions effortlessly.

**The Problem it Addresses**
Investing in stocks typically comes with a multitude of questions regarding compliance with Shariah law. Traditional financial metrics can be convoluted and frequently changing, making it hard for Muslims to know where their money is going. Amal Invest removes that uncertainty by providing a platform where users can set their investment preferences just once and access a tailored universe of compliant investment options.

**How It Works**
1. **Pick Funds**: Users can choose from over 100,000 ETFs and mutual funds, including renowned names like Fidelity and Vanguard.

3. **Invest**: With a single click, users can invest in this newly curated fund. Amal takes care of rebalancing and synchronization, making the process seamless.

**Investment Performance**
Studies show that Shariah-compliant companies often perform better due to their adherence to sound financial practices. Users can expect to see returns that exceed market averages—an appealing prospect for anyone looking to grow their wealth.

As it stands, mass spectrometry (mass spec) has long been the gold standard for characterizing complex biological samples, thanks to its unique combination of accuracy, sensitivity, and resolution. However, existing workflows often fall short due to low-throughput sample preparation and limited analytical insights, creating a bottleneck in the drug development process.

### Andson's Solution: DynaCHIP

Enter **DynaCHIP**, Andson Biotech's innovative system designed to streamline mass spectrometry workflows. By incorporating advanced microfluidics, DynaCHIP reduces sample preparation to a mere second, drastically accelerating the entire mass spec process. This allows drug developers to obtain rapid results that were previously unattainable—cutting down on both time and costs while enhancing the reliability of drug metrics.

### Simplifying Biotherapeutic Development

Andson Biotech focuses on three key areas: 

1. **Accelerate and Simplify Measurements:** By optimizing conventional mass spec workflows, they help researchers get the insights they need more efficiently.
   
2. **Improve Assays for Drug Discovery:** DynaCHIP facilitates the creation of better, faster assays, helping bring advanced therapies to market quickly.
   
3. **High-Throughput Bioanalytics:** Their technology not only reduces costs and timelines but also allows for dynamic feedback control throughout the bioprocess.

### Conclusion

Founded in 2022 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, Ankr Health is based in San Francisco and is on a mission to transform healthcare delivery through generative AI. The company's aim is clear: to virtualize the traditional, brick-and-mortar infrastructures of clinics, making healthcare more efficient, intelligent, and accessible.

The context for Ankr Health's inception is compelling. Telehealth 1.0, once seen as a frontier for innovation in healthcare, has seen adoption rates plummet to under 5%. Why? It's largely due to inefficiencies and a lack of intelligent systems that can support clinic operations. Ankr Health swoops in with a game-changing solution: by using generative AI to automate and enhance the roles of clinic staff—think front desk personnel, medical assistants, and scribes—they enable doctors to launch virtual clinics as needed, from anywhere in the world.

This approach is not just about tech for tech's sake. The numbers speak volumes. Clinics utilizing Ankr generate an average of $1 million in new revenue annually. That's not just a significant boost for individual practices—it's a meaningful contribution to the healthcare ecosystem as a whole.

Ankr Health integrates seamlessly with all the top Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and caters to a diverse clientele, focusing primarily on mid- to large-sized healthcare organizations. With a dedicated team of 30 employees, Ankr is positioned to scale its operations and impact.

As the company continues to develop its services, it stands firmly in the realms of generative AI, telehealth, and digital health, making waves in the B2B space. As we look toward the future of healthcare, Ankr Health is certainly a company to keep an eye on.

**Company Overview**: 
AstroForge is an ambitious startup that took flight in 2021, proudly part of Y Combinator’s Batch W22. Based in Huntington Beach, CA, this ten-person team is dedicated to a singular, audacious mission: we mine asteroids. They’ve recognized that the jewels of the cosmos hold immense potential for extracting precious metals while minimizing the environmental costs of traditional mining practices.

**Mission and Vision**:
The core mission of AstroForge is concise yet profound: to extract valuable minerals from asteroids, specifically Platinum Group Metals (PGMs), in a cost-effective manner that leaves no carbon footprint on Earth. Current terrestrial mining operations are destructive, consuming vast swathes of land and producing toxic waste. In contrast, AstroForge’s asteroid mining approach promises a cleaner, greener solution—less impact on our planet, and more resources to fuel technological advancements.

**Current Projects**:
AstroForge's second mission, aptly named ""Odin,"" is scheduled to launch within this year aboard Intuitive Machines’ IM-2 lunar mission. Odin will gather crucial imagery of its target asteroid, paving the way for the subsequent mission, ""Vestri,"" which will land on the asteroid and commence extraction operations.

**Key Technologies**: 
AstroForge operates at the intersection of hard tech, robotics, and space exploration. They aim to innovate and refine processes that break down celestial bodies to harvest only the valuable components, a clever pivot from attempting to haul back entire asteroids.

**The Team and Support**:
Under the guidance of Group Partner Garry Tan, the small but agile team at AstroForge is prepared for the challenges of space resources. They are backed by notable investors and have grown into a tight-knit organization passionate about reshaping mining for a sustainable future.

**In Summary**:
AstroForge is more than just a company—it represents a monumental leap towards harnessing outer space resources for the betterment of Earth. With their innovative model and dedicated team, they’re positioned not just to transform industries on the ground but to set the stage for a new era of interplanetary resource management.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W22,,,"Attain is a one-stop shop for convenience store owners to buy inventory across all their suppliers with higher reliability, price transparency, and product discovery.

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

Looking forward to meeting and connecting!"", 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/vansh-langer-md/'}]","**Company Overview: BBy**

BBy is a forward-thinking health-tech startup based in New York, focused on revolutionizing the way hospitals manage breast milk for the most vulnerable patients—newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Founded in 2017 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch W22, BBy introduces an innovative condensing technology that transforms breast milk into a fine powder, preserving its immunological properties and extending its shelf life to six months.

**Mission and Vision**

The mission of BBy is straightforward yet critical: to improve infant nutrition by providing hospitals with an easy solution to store, manage, and administer breast milk without the hassle of freezing and defrosting, which can consume valuable nursing time. The goal is to ""Nurture the Future"" of infant care. 

**The Technology**

At the heart of BBy’s innovation is a condensing device that efficiently removes unbound water from breast milk, allowing it to be reconstituted simply by adding water. This means hospitals no longer need large freezers, which not only saves energy but also gives nurses more time to focus on patient care. The process is safe, fully peer-reviewed, and already yielding positive results across over 20 hospitals in the New York Tri-State area.

**Team and Expertise**

BBy is spearheaded by Dr. Vansh Langer, a physician with a rich academic background, coupled with Dr. Blanca Aguilar Uscanga, a bioengineering and food science PhD. Together, they bring a wealth of expertise in infant nutrition, with more than 50 published works in their respective fields.

**Current Offerings and Impact**

BBy’s technology addresses longstanding inefficiencies in NICUs. Here's how:
1. **Condensed Milk**: The milk remains nutritionally equivalent to its liquid counterpart but is easier to store and administer.
2. **Efficient Storage**: Milk is batched and sorted for quick access during nursing shifts, significantly reducing the risk of errors.
3. **Cost Savings**: By eliminating the need to defrost, hospitals save time and reduce electricity costs.

**Future Directions**

However, in a significant turn of events, Better Opinions ceased operations on September 30, 2023, due to unspecified business reasons. Despite shutting down, the company reassured users that their ability to withdraw funds from the app would remain unaffected.

Why focus on business aviation? Because it's the most emissions-intensive segment of air travel, producing up to ten times more CO2 per passenger compared to commercial flights. This makes Beyond Aero's work not just innovative, but necessary.

Furthermore, they've appointed Luiz Oliveira, a veteran of Embraer’s hybrid hydrogen program, as Chief Engineer, which speaks volumes about their expertise in this innovative domain.

Financially, Beyond Aero is making waves. They've secured $914 million in Letters of Intent for 108 aircraft and have garnered multiple accolades, including recognition from the World Economic Forum for their sustainable aviation initiatives.

BotCity, founded in 2020 and now part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, is transforming the landscape of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for tech teams. Nestled in San Francisco with a compact team of 18, BotCity aims to provide an open-source, Python-based platform that streamlines automation across various business processes.

**Mission**  
At its core, BotCity believes in democratizing automation. While many low-code platforms claim that any business user can build automations, BotCity took a more pragmatic approach.

3. **Comprehensive Tools**: Through products like BotCity Orchestrator, Devtools, and Insights, the company is focused on enhancing the entire automation lifecycle from design to deployment.

**The Market Position**  
With an estimated 100,000 skilled RPA users compared to 22 million developers ready to dive into coding, BotCity is uniquely positioned. Their platform allows these developers to start automating effectively from day one, enhancing productivity and driving significant savings. In a world where businesses are increasingly tech-focused, automation is becoming a critical KPI, and BotCity's goal is to lead this change.

**Results & Impact**  
The effectiveness of BotCity's platform is evident. Clients have reported drastic reductions in manual labor and operational costs—like LG Electronics Brazil saving over 15,000 hours of work, and Grupo Saga automating 3,700 hours while also achieving significant cost reductions. These success stories highlight the practical benefits of transitioning from low-code to BotCity's Python-based automation.

**Mission**

At its core, Brainboard aims to provide a platform that allows engineers to visually design and manage their cloud infrastructures. They focus on making the shift to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) seamless, lowering the learning curve, and promoting a self-service model for businesses. No more starting from scratch; you have a service catalog to build from.

**What They Offer**

Brainboard offers a collaborative, end-to-end solution for handling cloud infrastructure needs. Here are the main features and use cases they're tackling:

- **Self-Serve Model**: Empower teams to set up and manage resources independently.
- **Shift to IaC**: Facilitate the transition to Infrastructure as Code, allowing automatic generation of Terraform code as you design.
- **Lower Learning Curve**: Simplified interfaces that make cloud management approachable for everyone.
- **Standardize IaC**: Create a framework that ensures consistency across different cloud environments.

Their platform boasts functionalities like a **smart cloud designer**, **GitOps workflow**, **drift detection**, and **synchronized architectures**. The idea is straightforward: manage complex infrastructures without the complexity.

**Team and Location**

Brainboard operates with a growing team of 12 employees, primarily based out of New York. They are backed by industry veterans and resources from several significant partners, including features associated with AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Imagine being able to sketch out your infrastructure and have the corresponding Terraform code generated instantly. This capability not only speeds up the design process but enhances collaboration across teams, as everyone can contribute without getting lost in technical details.

Furthermore, Brainboard is committed to providing robust security measures through its remote backend solutions, versioning, and role-based access control (RBAC). They understand the importance of securing sensitive data while streamlining team access.

**Conclusion**

In a cloud landscape that’s increasingly complex, Brainboard emerges as a breath of fresh air.

Their vision is compelling. By using biotechnology to produce milk directly from cells rather than requiring cows, Brown Foods aims to cut the carbon footprint of traditional dairy by over 90%. This is not just a win for the planet; it’s a leap towards cruelty-free consumption for dairy lovers.

Imagine enjoying your favorite dairy products without the associated guilt — that’s the promise Brown Foods is bringing to consumers.

The company is currently a lean operation, consisting of a five-member team guided by their group partner, Nan. This small yet ambitious team has partnered with advisors from renowned institutions like MIT and Harvard, further enhancing their credibility and expertise in molecular biology and food technology. 

As they continue to innovate in fields like cellular agriculture and food tech, Brown Foods is not only pushing the boundaries of how we think about milk but also inviting consumers to rethink their choices.

Initially focused on the gaming sector, Campfire is developing games that leverage large language model (LLM) technology to create engaging AI-driven gameplay experiences. They're essentially crafting interactive worlds where AI agents are not just add-ons—they're the heart of the gameplay itself. This approach is set to revolutionize entertainment, perhaps even more profoundly than the advent of 3D rendering or the internet did.

Their vision encapsulates the belief that AI will facilitate deeper storytelling, more immersive experiences, and innovative tools for developers.

A glimpse into their current projects reveals an array of intriguing offerings. First up is **Sprites.AI**, their flagship AI engine designed for creating agents in games and consumer applications. This suite provides tools for creative developers to foster the next wave of interactive media, starting with conversational agents powered by LLMs, but with plans to expand into image, video, and audio capabilities.

Their other noteworthy endeavor is **Cozy Friends**, described as “Animal Crossing with AI NPCs.” This project presents a glimpse into the potential of AI in simulation gaming, blending companionship and interaction seamlessly.

Looking ahead, Campfire has exciting announcements on the horizon: **Aurora**, a supportive companion AI, and **Qualia**, which promises to immerse users in a universe of personal expression.

At Campfire, the belief is simple: with the right tools, developers can create extraordinary experiences that were once thought impossible. As they work towards enabling the next generation of interactive media with their cutting-edge technologies, they position themselves as not just participants but leaders in a revolutionary space.

Founded in 2021 and nestled in Oslo, Norway, Carbon Crusher is blazing a trail in sustainable road construction with a bold mission: to create carbon-negative roads. It’s not just a catchy tagline; they’re redefining how we think about infrastructure and environmental responsibility.

**The Breakdown**

The company’s journey began with a straightforward yet impactful premise: refurbishing roads that desperately need maintenance. By reusing old road materials and employing carbon-binding lignin instead of heavy oil, Carbon Crusher not only reduces costs but also builds roads that actively sequester around 1.5 tonnes of CO2 for every 100 feet paved. Think about that—every mile paved could potentially store between 50 and 150 tonnes of CO2, making a significant impact in the fight against climate change.

**Innovative Services**

Carbon Crusher operates under a unique model dubbed “Crushing As A Service (CRAAS).” This innovative approach targets both public and private road owners, offering a sustainable solution that integrates advanced satellite imagery to monitor road conditions and performance. The use of AI-enabled maintenance insights, through their SkyRoads platform, rounds off a robust service that addresses the long-term needs of road infrastructure while prioritizing environmental sustainability.

**Team and Recognition**

With a dedicated team of 21 and backing from Y Combinator's Batch W22, Carbon Crusher isn’t just a startup; it’s a growing movement in construction and climate action. Led by Gustaf Alstromer, they are gaining international traction and drawing attention from various media outlets for their groundbreaking approach.

**Key Offerings:**

1. **Sustainable Road Construction:** Utilizing on-site materials through full-depth reclamation, they create stronger and longer-lasting roads that require less maintenance.
   
2. **Cost Efficiency:** Their innovative methods drive down costs, making eco-friendly road construction both viable and financially sound.
   
3. **Climate Impact:** They don’t just build roads; they contribute actively to carbon capture, making infrastructure a part of the solution to the climate crisis.

**The Bigger Picture**

With over 64 million kilometers of roads around the world, the potential for transformation is immense. Carbon Crusher isn’t just about building roads; they’re about building a future where our infrastructure heals the planet. Their seamless integration of technology and environmentalism positions them as not just a company, but a pioneer in the paradigm shift toward sustainable construction.

**Founding and Background**
Circular was founded in 2021 and quickly became a part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2022 batch. Operating out of Singapore, it employs a dedicated team of 25 individuals. The company is primarily focused on revolutionizing how consumers access technology through a subscription model, making it a central player in the Asian market for consumer electronics.

**Mission**
The mission of Circular is straightforward yet impactful: to promote the circular economy by providing convenient, affordable subscriptions for consumer electronics throughout Asia. By transitioning from ownership to rental, Circular aims to redefine our relationship with technology.

**What They Offer**
Circular has designed its services to cater to the tech-savvy consumer who wants access to the latest gadgets—think smartphones, laptops, VR equipment, and gaming gear—without the hefty price tag associated with outright purchases. Here’s how it works:

1. **Choose**: Customers select the device they want and determine their subscription length.
2. **Order**: After creating an account, they’ll receive confirmation of their spending power.
3. **Delivery**: Devices are delivered for free right to the customer’s doorstep.
4. **Options**: At the end of the subscription, users can choose to upgrade, extend, or return the device.

If a customer decides to return a device, Circular refurbishes and rents it out again, extending its lifecycle and reducing waste—a win-win for consumers and the planet.

**Business Model**
By promoting a subscription model, Circular encourages users to experience ownership without the commitment. This approach not only aligns with sustainability but also reflects changing consumer preferences, where renting is becoming as accepted as owning.

**Target Market**
Circular primarily operates in Singapore and Australia, two regions with high technology adoption rates. By tapping into these markets, Circular caters to a tech-savvy, environmentally-conscious demographic looking for budget-friendly options.

**Industry Positioning**
Circular positions itself at the intersection of several industries, tagged under fintech, marketplace, consumer electronics, and e-commerce. This broad positioning enables it to be flexible and innovative in how it addresses consumer needs.

**Team and Support**
Backing and mentorship from seasoned partners, including Dalton Caldwell from Y Combinator, provide Circular with the resources needed to thrive and innovate in this space.

**Conclusion**

They’ve come up with a catheter-based solution that stands out in the crowded field of medical devices. 

So, what exactly does Corveus do? Their innovative device is designed to perform a targeted nerve ablation in the upper abdomen, which deactivates a nerve known to contribute to heart failure. This process is notable for its precision. Unlike traditional ablation techniques that might cause collateral damage to surrounding tissues, Corveus's approach targets the affected area while also confirming that the procedure has been completed successfully. This is a game-changer for cardiologists concerned about the risks associated with nerve ablation.

Corveus Medical is part of Y Combinator's Winter 2022 batch, which means they are among a carefully selected group of startups gaining valuable mentorship and resources to accelerate their growth. Despite being a small team of just three employees, they’re backed by significant industry partnerships, including collaboration with Nan.

The company is focused on a humanitarian goal: providing effective, safe treatment options for moderate heart failure patients, a demographic often left with limited choices. They recognize the unmet need in this space and are committed to improving the quality of life for these patients.

Liza (Sales Executive) - Engages in natural voice conversations throughout the sales cycle, from initial prospect calls to negotiations and closure. She handles qualification calls, follow-ups, and maintains CRM records while building rapport through intelligent dialogue.

CozmoX AI, founded in 2024 and based in Abu Dhabi, UAE, is tackling the workplace communication landscape with the first voice AI employee platform aimed at the Middle East and Africa. They’re transforming how businesses interact with customers by deploying AI “employees” that manage conversations and repetitive tasks around the clock—think of it as your 24/7 workforce that never sleeps, eats, or takes holidays.

This startup has launched three AI personalities—Liza (Sales Executive), Alex (Debt Collector), and Zara (Receptionist)—each designed to perform key roles traditionally held by humans. Liza expertly navigates the sales cycle, engaging potential clients and managing CRM records; Alex handles debt collection with professional finesse; and Zara manages front-office duties, from routing calls to keeping track of appointments.

So, what’s the big deal? Well, these AI employees are not just glorified chatbots. They're backed by sophisticated voice technology that enables them to conduct natural, human-like conversations. For companies, this means less time dealing with mundane tasks and more energy focused on innovation and customer engagement.

CozmoX AI operates through a no-code platform, enhancing accessibility for businesses without requiring extensive technical know-how. Their AI solutions can replace multiple software tools, simplifying operations and potentially saving millions in labor costs. By just hiring one AI worker, businesses can achieve the output of ten human employees, significantly boosting efficiency without expanding headcount.

Their technology isn’t just a novelty—it's designed to learn and adapt. Each interaction helps the AI become smarter, providing increasingly contextual and relevant responses over time, which is essential for modern customer service dynamics.

CozmoX AI has gained traction in the startup ecosystem, having secured $3 million in funding from notable investors, including Y Combinator and other venture funds.

Founded in 2021 and based in New York, Craniometrix is a forward-thinking health-tech company on a mission to simplify and improve care for Alzheimer’s patients and their families.

With over $6 million in funding under its belt, Craniometrix is committed to creating a one-stop-shop care platform tailored for this need.

At the heart of Craniometrix's platform is the recognition that caregivers—often spouses or children—carry the weight of providing care. This role can lead to significant stress and time demands. By optimizing the monitoring, management, and intervention processes, Craniometrix aims to alleviate the burden on caregivers and enhance outcomes for patients.

Their integrated approach ensures that healthcare professionals can maintain a continuous line of communication, ultimately driving better patient outcomes. Best of all, the services are offered at no cost to patients, thanks to reimbursements made through Medicare's new initiatives.

Positioned as a solution akin to Clearbanc (now Clear.co) for the Latin American market, Creizer focuses on providing revenue-based financing to online sellers—crucial support in a region where over 80% of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) struggle to access loans.

The heart of Creizer's innovation lies in its unique risk model. Unlike traditional financing, which often relies on credit scores and collateral, Creizer assesses sellers based on their store metrics and daily sales. This makes funding not just more accessible, but also more aligned with the sellers’ actual performance.  

The company has been experiencing impressive growth—65% month-over-month—and reports that its financing helps customers scale their businesses by up to seven times within a year. With a dedicated team of 12, Creizer is positioned to capture a significant market opportunity, given that SMEs make up 99% of online sellers in Latin America.

Their simple process allows sellers to apply for credit quickly: fill out a contact form, connect sales accounts to a predictive engine, and receive a proposal within 72 hours. Flexible conditions mean no fixed payments; instead, sellers pay based on their sales performance, ensuring that if business slows, payments do too.

Creizer is not just about financing; it’s about empowering a new generation of online entrepreneurs in LATAM. This approach has already earned trust from over 500 sellers in Mexico who praise the company for its flexibility and personalized service.

With a mission to automate contract review processes using AI, Dioptra helps founders and in-house counsel close deals faster by streamlining negotiations and providing customizable playbooks.

### What They Do

Dioptra leverages AI to facilitate contract review, allowing users to generate accurate redlines directly in Microsoft Word. The platform is designed to derive playbooks from existing agreements, ensuring that reviews are consistent and aligned with organizational guidelines. 

A standout feature is their new tool, PromptIQ, designed to offer accurate AI assistance at your fingertips. This tool, combined with Dioptra's ability to integrate seamlessly with document repositories, makes contract management more efficient and less labor-intensive.

### Features That Stand Out

- **Playbooks & Customization**: Whether you have a playbook or need to create one, Dioptra can accommodate both, enhancing your review process.
- **Word Add-in**: Users can work comfortably within familiar environments, integrating their operations directly into Microsoft Word.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Dioptra boasts impressive accuracy rates—95% for first-party documents, 92% for third-party papers, and 94% for issue detection.

### Why It Matters

Contract review is traditionally seen as a tedious and time-consuming task.

Duplo is a forward-thinking startup, founded in 2021 and part of the Y Combinator Batch W22, aiming to create a B2B payment ecosystem akin to Venmo, specifically designed for the African market. With a mission to simplify financial operations across the continent, Duplo quickly jumped into the spotlight, attracting attention and resources as it worked to streamline how businesses handle payments, expenses, and vendor management.

### What They Do

Duplo's platform offers a comprehensive suite of solutions tailored for corporations seeking efficiency in financial operations. Their core products include:

- **Expense Management:** Automate and track expenditures seamlessly.
- **Global Payments:** Facilitate local and international payments from a single dashboard.
- **Vendor Management:** Simplify the process of managing bills and approvals.

### Key Features

Duplo's technology focuses on enhancing payment workflows and ensuring smoother operational processes through features like:

Founded in 2021, Engage Bio is on a mission to combat cancer using innovative mRNA immunotherapies. Based in Santa Clara, CA, and part of the Y Combinator Batch W22, the company's team of five is harnessing their extensive experience in immunotherapy, which includes four drugs currently in clinical trials.

Engage Bio’s unique approach revolves around their creation of “Tethosomes”—a new class of non-viral DNA delivery systems designed to enable potent, durable, and scalable genetic medicine. Their platform directly addresses the traditional challenges of mRNA therapeutic development, such as potency and toxicity. By using lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology, Engage Bio effectively delivers therapeutic DNA along with mRNA that encodes their proprietary Tethosome protein. This protein ensures that the therapeutic DNA is localized to the nucleus, dramatically increasing expression levels by over 100 times while remaining invisible to the immune system.

The core idea? Instead of simply treating cancer, Engage Bio provides cancer cells with the instructions to produce and release their own therapeutic agents directly within the tumor environment. This targeted delivery aims to eradicate tumors more effectively while minimizing collateral damage to healthy tissue.

The leadership team includes co-founders Will Olsen (CEO) and Kathryn Kwant (CSO), along with other key scientists with impressive backgrounds in biomedicine. Notably, they are focusing on building partnerships in areas such as oncology, gene replacement, and therapeutic protein expression to broaden the application of their Tethosome technology.

With a clear vision and a sophisticated technology platform, Engage Bio stands out as a promising contender in the biotech landscape, targeting one of humanity's most pressing challenges—cancer.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from Houston, TX, Fleetzero is on a mission to revolutionize the shipping industry by building battery-electric cargo ships. Their innovative approach is notable: these ships operate with five times higher net margins compared to conventional fossil fuel vessels. Their battery technology is being touted as the key to decarbonizing the $1.3 trillion shipping sector—without imposing a green premium on operators.

Fleetzero is tackling a massive challenge with a smart solution. As companies like Amazon, Ikea, and Patagonia aim for zero-carbon shipping by 2040, Fleetzero’s technology is positioned to make that goal feasible. The company's flagship product, the Leviathan Energy Storage System (ESS), is said to be the world’s most advanced marine battery. It allows vessels to operate with zero emissions in port and during short sea operations. By hybridizing existing vessels with the Leviathan system, ship owners can reduce operational emissions dramatically, and the projects themselves often pay for some of their upfront costs through fuel and maintenance savings.

What’s particularly compelling about Fleetzero's offering is the promise it holds: a single voyage on one of their ships can prevent as much CO2 emissions as planting 92,577 trees and allowing them to grow for a decade. This dramatic reduction in emissions is already attracting attention from both the media and investors, including significant players like Y Combinator, Founders Fund, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

As a part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, they've taken an innovative approach to healthcare by bridging the gap between hospital-level care and the convenience of home treatment.

The company's initial service, known simply as Float, aimed to revolutionize how patients cope with chronic illnesses. Instead of hauling patients to sometimes crowded hospitals, Float brings qualified nurses to their homes, providing the necessary medical care right where they are most comfortable. This commitment to home care is not just about convenience; it's about enhancing patient experience and outcomes.

Float Health’s unique model is structured around specialty pharmacies. They manage to secure top-notch nursing staff quickly, typically staffing within minutes instead of the days or weeks it might take through traditional agencies. This agility has resulted in impressive metrics: they have conducted over 35,000 home visits and boast a medication completion rate 180% higher than typical home infusion patients, coupled with a staggering staffing success rate of 98-100%.

In terms of financial efficiency, Float Health is equally compelling — their tech-driven solutions reduce administrative burdens for pharmacies and streamline reimbursement processes. This results in cost savings compared to managing in-house nursing teams or relying on external agencies.

With a small, dedicated team of three, and notable backing from Michael Seibel as a group partner, Float Health is making a mark as a trusted partner for pharmacies, healthcare payers, and prescribers alike. They promise reliable, high-quality care without the waste — both in terms of resources and time.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W22,,,"Fogbender helps B2B companies support customer teams: think Intercom meets Slack's shared channels.

Today, all customer software is explicitly or implicitly designed for helping individuals, not teams. This is forcing B2B companies - who sell products to teams, not individuals - to augment their default customer support platform (Zendesk, Intercom, Front, etc) with a second, ""unofficial"", system: Slack's shared channels.

This causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.

With Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions.",2020.0,"[{'name': 'Andrei Soroker, Founder', 'description': ""I was born in 1981 in Novosibirsk, USSR.

Founded in 2020 and part of Y Combinator's Winter '22 batch, Fogbender is redefining customer support for businesses that sell APIs. Based in Oakland, CA, with a nimble team of six, Fogbender emerges at a crucial moment when traditional customer support systems—think Zendesk or Intercom—often fail to cater to the needs of teams. Instead, they’re designed for individual use, leading to operational chaos in B2B environments. 

**The Problem**  
In B2B interactions, companies need tools that facilitate communication among teams. Current solutions leave gaps, causing issues like lack of transparency, duplicated efforts, and ultimately, diminished customer satisfaction. The result? Increased costs, lost opportunities, and higher churn rates.

**The Solution**  
Fogbender tackles these challenges with an innovative, purpose-built customer support tool that embeds team-to-team messaging directly into customer dashboards. This means all users associated with a company can easily engage in support conversations without additional authentication. Fogbender's features include:

1. **Embeddable Messaging Widget**: Connects users of a customer organization directly with support agents—making teamwork seamless.
2. **Fogbender Agent App**: Designed particularly for B2B communication, this app manages the flow of messages between vendors and customers.
3. **Ticket Management**: Support conversations can be linked to ticketing systems like Jira, GitHub, and Asana, ensuring smooth workflows.
4. **Integrations**: Two-way sync capabilities with platforms like Microsoft Teams and Slack allow teams to communicate within their preferred environments without losing track of conversations.
5. **AI Assistance**: Intelligent support features help agents handle complex user queries efficiently.

Nick Mehta, CEO of Gainsight, endorses Fogbender's approach, noting the longstanding oversight in the tooling available for B2B customer support. With Fogbender poised to shake up this space, companies can expect improved operational efficiency and better customer experiences.

Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, Gauss offers a unique financial solution that allows individuals with good credit scores to significantly reduce their credit card interest rates while still using their cards.

The process is pretty straightforward: users connect their existing credit cards with the Gauss mobile app, which then provides a revolving line of credit in under 10 minutes. This innovative system tracks users' spending, automatically pays off high-interest balances, and helps them save thousands in interest charges over time. By managing payments smartly and efficiently, Gauss not only expedites the payoff process but also actively works to improve users' credit scores.

Gauss is led by a compact team of 16 employees, with notable support from Michael Seibel as their Group Partner. Their platform is designed for anyone who has unpaid credit card balances or uses multiple credit cards frequently. Essentially, if you’re feeling the weight of high-interest credit card debt, Gauss might be your new best friend.

Users enjoy a range of services through the app, including:

1. **Lower Interest Rates**: Users can transfer high-interest balances to Gauss’s lower APR line (between 14% - 18%).
   
2. **Credit Building**: Tools like Gauss’s Credit Builder help improve credit scores with minimal effort—some products even require no credit checks and feature monthly payments under $5.

3. **Rewards System**: By interacting with the app and making timely payments, users earn rewards points that can be used to offset fees, reduce APRs, or access premium services.

4. **Automated Payments**: Users can set up autopay for their credit cards to ensure bills are paid on time, avoiding late fees and interest.

5. **Personalized Plans**: The app can help users create tailored plans for debt repayment based on their financial circumstances.

As a tech company rather than a bank, Gauss positions itself as a helpful ally in managing credit card debt efficiently. It charges a small monthly subscription fee starting at $4.99, which can be canceled at any time. Gauss is particularly useful for those who struggle with multiple credit cards—making financial management less stressful and more intuitive.

In essence, if you’re dealing with the chaos of credit card debt and looking for a streamlined solution, Gauss offers a compelling approach that blends technology with personal finance.

Founded in 2021 and nestled in Ibadan, Nigeria, Heyfood is on a mission to become the “Doordash for Africa.” In a continent where food delivery services are still catching up, Heyfood has carved out a unique position by ensuring profitability from day one on every delivery—a sharp contrast to the struggling delivery models seen elsewhere. 

The startup targets Millennials and Gen Z urban professionals in Africa's top 70 cities. With projections suggesting that this demographic will grow to 140 million over the next decade, Heyfood forecasts a substantial opportunity. They estimate that if each of these individuals orders food just once a week, that creates a potential market worth $51 billion. By charging a modest $1 per delivery, they're tapping into a lucrative pool that is both sizable and increasingly tech-savvy.

Heyfood is part of the Y Combinator Batch W22, placing it among a lineage of successful startups. Despite being a small team of five, they are well-connected, with Michael Seibel as their Group Partner. This lean structure positions them to iterate quickly and respond to the African market's unique challenges and opportunities.

In simple terms, Heyfood is working to make ordering from your favorite restaurants as easy as clicking a button. They're not just building a delivery service; they’re creating an ecosystem that promises to transform how food is accessed in urban Africa.

Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch W22, Hubble Network is a Seattle-based startup on a groundbreaking mission: to connect a billion Bluetooth-enabled devices directly to a global satellite network—essentially, “Bluetooth to Space.” With a small but dedicated team of 20, Hubble is reshaping the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape by bridging the gap between everyday devices and satellite connectivity, even in the absence of cellular networks.

#### What They Do

Hubble Network simplifies the connection to space for wireless devices. The secret sauce? Off-the-shelf Bluetooth chips. Instead of relying on proprietary modems or custom hardware, users can simply upload Hubble's firmware to their existing devices to access global satellite communications. The array of potential applications is vast, including:

- **Asset Tracking**: Attach a BLE chip to any item and track its location affordably, globally.
- **Wildfire Detection**: Use integrated temperature sensors to alert you of fire risks from remote areas directly to satellites.
- **Fleet Management**: Move beyond traditional tracking services with Hubble’s efficient solutions for managing heavy equipment and deliveries.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Collect high-quality environmental data in even the most remote locations, without extensive infrastructure.

With a focus on sectors like agriculture, environmental monitoring, smart buildings, and logistics, Hubble is geared towards enabling IoT applications that were previously impractical at scale.

#### Why It Matters

Imagine if every package shipped, every piece of machinery operating in the field, or even every wildfire risk could be monitored from space. That’s the ambition of Hubble Network. They’re not just pushing the boundaries of IoT; they’re unlocking an entire ecosystem of human-machine collaboration. By enabling a global, satellite-connected network with just Bluetooth, they're set to create a new era for both businesses and consumers who depend on real-time information.

Under the leadership of Diana Hu and with its innovative tech, Hubble Network is poised to gain traction in an expanding market. If successful, they won’t just revolutionize tracking and monitoring but also catalyze new economic opportunities across numerous industries.

Founded in 2021 and proudly part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, Hydra aims to make it remarkably easier for developers to build applications and analytics on real-time data. At its core, Hydra revolutionizes how we think about data analytics by eliminating the need for traditional databases that require extensive data ingestion and transformation—a process that can take up precious time and resources.

### What Makes Hydra Stand Out?

**Speed and Efficiency**: Hydra operates 100-1000 times faster than conventional analytics databases (OLAP), allowing high-performance analytical processing to run directly on live transactional data. No need for zero-ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) means you can dive straight into analytics without the usual headaches.

**Fully Managed Infrastructure**: Every project on Hydra includes a fully managed Postgres database, integrated analytical processing, and globally distributed object storage. This setup allows developers to implement sub-second analytics across applications, making it possible to deliver complex insights in just an afternoon.

**Open Source and Accessible**: Positioned in the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area with a team of six, Hydra embraces an open-source model. This allows a broad community of developers to contribute and benefit from its capabilities. The company's tech is particularly appealing to developers seeking robust analytics engines without the complexities of large enterprise solutions.

### Current Offerings

Recently, Hydra launched a new feature: the DuckDB-Powered Postgres extension, ""pg_duckdb,"" bringing together the best of both worlds—the transactional power of Postgres and the analytical capabilities of DuckDB. This integration allows for rapid querying on vast datasets without the overhead usually associated with syncing data between separate databases.

### Community and Support

Tom Blomfield, a Group Partner at Y Combinator, is among those excited about what Hydra brings to the table. Their approach is not just about efficiency but also about fostering collaboration among developers through strong community support and user-friendly documentation.

### The Bottom Line

Whether you're building complex apps or diving deep into data analytics, Hydra simplifies the process and enhances performance with cutting-edge technology. With a strong foundation in open-source principles, ongoing community engagement, and a commitment to making data exploration straightforward, Hydra is carving out an essential niche in the developer tools landscape.

Founded in 2020 and originally known as Impossible Mining, Impossible Metals is on a mission to revolutionize the extraction of critical battery metals from the seabed while keeping environmental stewardship at the forefront. Their focus? Developing cutting-edge underwater robotic vehicles that can efficiently collect polymetallic nodules — rock formations rich in valuable metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper, which are crucial for manufacturing electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

The team, based in Pasadena, California, is currently 20 strong and supported by Gustaf Alstromer, a partner at Y Combinator, where Impossible Metals emerged as part of Batch W22. They've made impressive strides, securing over $500 million in off-take Letters of Intent and partnering with a major global offshore logistics company that possesses a seabed mining exploration permit. In their pursuit of innovation, they've already developed and successfully tested their first Proof of Concept underwater robotic arm.

What makes Impossible Metals stand out is not just its technology, but its commitment to sustainability and responsible mining practices. They aim to harvest these rare materials without damaging marine ecosystems, addressing one of the most pressing concerns surrounding deep-sea mining. With the EV market booming and the demand for such critical metals increasing, their ethical approach seeks to navigate this complex landscape responsibly.

Impossible Metals engages with the broader community, educating the public through webinars and blogs about deep-sea mining, environmental impacts, and regulatory frameworks. The company is also aligned with numerous UN Sustainable Development Goals, making clear its intent to contribute positively to global challenges like climate action (SDG #13) and responsible consumption and production (SDG #12).

So, if you’re keen on exploring the future of sustainable mining and the breakthroughs in robotic technology poised to reshape our approach to resource extraction, keep an eye on Impossible Metals. With their blend of innovation, environmental consideration, and strategic partnerships, they're attempting something that seemed impossible—extracting riches from the depths of the ocean without leaving a mark.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from the vibrant tech hub of San Francisco, Joon Health is set on a mission to revolutionize pediatric behavioral healthcare for over 100 million families across the U.S. Initially part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2022 cohort, Joon has quickly carved its niche as an integrated digital health platform tailored for children grappling with behavioral disorders such as ADHD, autism, anxiety, and depression.

**What is Joon Health?**

At its core, Joon is a game-based digital therapeutic platform that empowers children to engage in real-life behavioral improvements. Kids earn points and level up in a game while their progress is monitored by both parents and clinicians. This gamification of therapy not only makes the process enjoyable for kids but also fosters a collaborative approach involving caregivers.

**Vision for the Future**

Over the next decade, Joon envisions becoming the go-to digital treatment solution for pediatric behavioral disorders. They’re leveraging a first-of-its-kind technology designed to drive significant behavioral change and enhance treatment adherence.

Joon Health equips families with a variety of resources aimed at enhancing parental engagement and overall treatment effectiveness, including:

- **Parent Resource Library**: Access to over 100 training materials to guide caregivers.
- **Data Collection Mobile App**: A user-friendly platform for parents to log behaviors conveniently.
- **Goal Tracking**: Automated tools for monitoring progress toward specific treatment goals.
- **Token Economy System**: A setup that encourages children through rewards for positive behaviors.
- **AI Session Notes**: Automated note-taking to streamline communication between clinicians and families.
- **Free AI Tools**: Resources that save clinicians time on administrative tasks.

These features are rooted in evidence-based methodologies and aim to reinforce the vital role parents play in their child’s treatment journey.

**Why Joon Health Matters**

The platform addresses a pressing problem in clinical settings—parent adherence to treatment protocols. By directly involving parents through intuitive tools and real-time data collection, Joon enhances treatment integrity and accountability. Clinicians can monitor progress more effectively, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

**Feedback from Clinicians and Families**

Clinicians are lauding Joon for its ability to bridge the gap between them and the families they serve. Parents, on the other hand, have found the platform transformative—turning what was once an overwhelming process into an engaging experience that children look forward to.

**Conclusion**

Joon Health is on a mission to fundamentally change how pediatric behavioral health is managed—transforming consultations into collaborations that genuinely involve families. If you're a parent navigating these challenges or a clinician looking to integrate a modern solution into your practice, Joon might just be what you need to level up your approach.

The company's current offerings—dubbed PeakPath—focus on personalized coaching, stress management, and better sleep, all powered by insights from wearables. Whether it’s helping consultants enhance their performance through improved sleep or reducing workplace stress, Lifted is tackling a fundamental issue: productivity 101 relies on health 101.

#### How It Works

Here's a simplified breakdown of their process:

1. **Assessment**: Employees complete a self-assessment and wear an Oura ring to gather data about their health.
2. **Personal Coaching**: After review, an assigned coach collaborates with each employee to devise a personalized plan targeting sleep and stress management.
3. **Tracking Progress**: Employees use an app to track their habits, gaining insights into how daily choices impact their wellbeing.
4. **Ongoing Support**: Coaches check in weekly, helping employees stay aligned with their wellness goals.

This method proves effective. Lifted boasts an impressive adoption rate—80% on average, with some teams reaching nearly 100%. Retention after six months is high, at 93%.

#### Achievements and Future Outlook

Lifted’s commitment to enhancing mental health has pegged it as a key player in the mental health tech sector, appealing to a variety of organizations—from Fortune 500 companies to private equity firms. Their approach is not just anecdotal; metrics show a substantial increase in employees’ mental wellbeing, with those reporting ""very high mental wellbeing"" rising from 7% to 25% in just six months.

With a dedicated team of nine and acted upon the governance of partners like Gustaf Alstromer, Lifted is poised to grow rapidly. They are not just offering coaching; they are fostering cultures that prioritize health at work, making them necessary stakeholders in the new age of employment.

In sum, Lifted is proving that the future of work shouldn’t just revolve around grind culture; it should focus on balance, health, and sustainable performance.

LunaJoy, founded in 2021, is a groundbreaking mental health platform specifically designed for women, addressing a spectrum of unique life phases—from adolescence to menopause. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, the company emerged as a part of Y Combinator’s Batch W22. They’ve assembled a team of six passionate individuals determined to make mental health care more precise, especially for women who experience mental health challenges at significantly higher rates than their male counterparts.

**Mission and Services**

At its core, LunaJoy’s mission is to provide precision mental health care tailored for women. This covers key life transitions such as pregnancy, postpartum challenges, infertility, and beyond. The platform employs a specialized workforce offering various services including targeted psychotherapy, medication management enhanced by genetic testing, holistic wellness, and coaching, all wrapped up in a user-friendly digital format.

They leverage technology and data science to create intelligent touchpoints that not only cut costs but also streamline outcomes, making mental health care more accessible and effective. Women's mental health is especially critical since studies show that women are twice as likely to struggle with mental health issues—this gap becomes even more pronounced among women of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.

**What They Offer**

- **Therapy and Counseling:** Virtual therapy specifically for women navigating complex emotional landscapes.
- **Medication Management:** Personalized medication plans that account for genetic factors, ensuring better outcomes.
- **Coaching and Holistic Wellness:** Comprehensive support assisting women not just in mental health but in overall wellness.
- **Insurance Coverage:** Clients can access services through various major insurance plans, making it financially viable for many.

**Why it Matters**

LunaJoy is not just another telehealth platform. It recognizes that women's mental health care is often overlooked, and aims to fill that gap with its specialized approach. They tackle common but serious issues, from postpartum depression to anxiety and grief, catering to every woman’s needs with empathy and expertise.

**Future and Growth**

This startup is on a growth trajectory, expanding its in-network footprint to ensure that all women have access to the care they need. With the right mix of innovation and compassion, LunaJoy is well-equipped to make a substantial impact in the digital health space.

The company’s mission is clear: create a “Carta for Web3”—a comprehensive platform that streamlines token vesting and DeFi investment management.

Starting off, Magna intended to build a platform that transforms DeFi investments into financial primitives. Their flagship product, Carta for Web3, allows companies to effectively manage their cap tables while seamlessly distributing token equity to employees, advisors, and investors. Think of it as the toolkit that companies need to navigate the complex maze of decentralized finance. 

But it doesn't stop there. Magna is also developing infrastructure tailored for institutional investors, enabling secure custody of investments with on-chain execution and intelligence. The ambition here is to leverage locked tokens as versatile building blocks for collateralized lending, vibrant secondary markets, and additional DeFi applications.

Feedback from clients makes it abundantly clear that existing processes in token management are often a burdensome chore. Many report spending hours checking and executing token transactions manually—a stark reminder of just how much room there is for improvement in this space. The consensus? A unified system could drastically reduce friction and risk, turning the “nice to have” into a “must-have.”

Magna stands out with a capable 18-member team and industry backing from notable entities like Tiger Global and Circle. They haven't just built a product; they've crafted a robust ecosystem compatible with major blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, among others. Their platform isn't just about distribution; it also includes features for tax compliance, multi-signature support, and customizable vesting schedules.

As for partnerships, they’re trusted by several leading companies in the space, affirming their credibility. They’ve undergone extensive audits, showcasing their commitment to security and reliability—critical factors in any financial application.

In a world where blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, sometimes it feels like we’re all playing catch-up. With Magna, companies can not only keep pace but move ahead, simplifying the complexities of token management. If you’re looking to launch a token or streamline current investments, Magna's the partner you want to have.

Founded in 2021 and based in Islamabad, Mahaana Wealth is making waves as Pakistan's first and only licensed digital wealth manager, operating under the regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). With a team of six ambitious professionals and the backing of notable sponsors, including Tundra Fonder from Sweden, Mahaana is on a mission to transform the investment landscape in Pakistan.

**What Sets Mahaana Apart?**

Mahaana Wealth started with a focus on retirement savings, addressing a staggering statistic: only 0.02% of the Pakistani population currently has retirement accounts. This gap presents a massive opportunity. Leveraging the regulatory changes from late 2021, which allowed for digital onboarding and simpler KYC processes, Mahaana intends to democratize access to wealth management. They have positioned themselves to create custom retirement funds and ETFs, similar to what Vanguard offers in the West.

**Investment Philosophy and Offerings**

Mahaana combines cutting-edge technology with expertise in financial management to provide tailored investment solutions. Their approach is rooted in understanding individual risk and return targets, optimizing management for higher yields at lower costs, and ensuring transparency through a personalized client portal. 

They offer various products like the Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund (MICF) and the Mahaana Islamic Index Exchange Traded Fund (MIIETF), which is set to start trading in March 2024. The company prides itself on handling Shariah-compliant assets, making it a viable option for investors concerned about ethical investment practices.

Mahaana invites clients to simplify their experience by allowing them to sign up and fund their accounts online in under ten minutes, starting with as little as PKR 1,000 (about $4). They employ an auto-invest strategy that adjusts to market conditions and client preferences, reducing the burden of active management for their customers.

**Looking Ahead**

As Mahaana Wealth continues to navigate the evolving investment climate in Pakistan, it stands ready to empower individuals with the tools they need to build wealth and secure their financial futures. By bridging the gap in retirement planning and investment accessibility, Mahaana represents not just a business, but a shift in how wealth is managed in the region.

In a market ripe for disruption, Mahaana’s commitment to innovation, transparency, and client-centric solutions positions it uniquely as a trailblazer in the fintech sector. As the first digital asset management company in Pakistan, it’s only the beginning for this forward-thinking firm.

Located in Los Angeles, CA, this innovative company is composed of a talented team of 11 individuals and is backed by support from notable investors including Aaron Epstein.

**Mission and Vision**

Massdriver’s mission is if not quite magic, pretty close: to enable teams to deploy secure, scalable cloud infrastructures in mere minutes, rather than days. They started by focusing on helping organizations build production-ready internal developer platforms quickly—cutting out the red tape that often bogs down cloud operations.

With an extensive library of 50+ infrastructure components, teams can easily construct and manage workflows on platforms like Kubernetes, serverless architectures, or traditional VMs. The beauty here is in the flexibility: product engineers get the autonomy they need while adhering to the security and auditing needs of operations teams.

**A Simplified Approach to Cloud Operations**

At Massdriver, they handle the ""boring"" elements of cloud operations—think Identity Access Management (IAM), secrets management, continuous deployment, alerting, and monitoring—so your teams can zero in on product development. They've embraced anti-lock-in principles by running in the customer’s own cloud and open-sourcing all of their infrastructure components. That’s flexibility you don’t see every day.

**Core Features**

Massdriver isn’t just any tool; it's tailored for modern development and operational challenges. Here’s what they bring to the table:

1. **Production Ready**: Secure, compliant reference architectures make ramping up easier than ever.
2. **Contextual Metrics**: Infrastructure diagrams come alive as actionable dashboards.
3. **Developer Self-Service**: Integrations into CI/CD systems allow developers to provision what they need—no more long waits for infrastructure requests.
4. **Unified Management**: Configuration management that seamlessly combines infrastructure and application oversight.
5. **Automated IAM**: Adheres to the principle of least privilege by default, fundamentally securing infrastructure setups.

**Real-World Impact**

Massdriver has made substantial contributions to various companies. For instance, AMD Global Telemedicine saw a remarkable **89% reduction** in software release efforts, while GameStake managed to **cut their cloud costs** by 25% using the platform. That's not just efficiency; that’s transformational.

**Community and Collaboration**

Massdriver is not just a tool; it's also a community. They actively engage through webinars, podcasts, and forums, creating an environment where users can learn and grow together.

Founded in 2021 and based in Mexico City, Momento is a fresh entrant in the auto insurance sector, aiming to revolutionize how insurance is offered in Latin America. With a mission to develop a full-stack auto insurer, they specifically target the significantly underserved market of over 30 million uninsured vehicles in Mexico, tapping into a $13 billion industry opportunity.

Just over a year into their journey, Momento has navigated a demanding regulatory process and has received approval to become a fully licensed insurance carrier. This status empowers them to underwrite risk and set prices, establishing their stake in the marketplace. The company combines the expertise of its three co-founders—two hailing from McKinsey and one from Procter & Gamble—with seasoned veterans from leading Mexican insurance firms, including former executives from Zurich and AXA.

Momento operates with a team of 18 dedicated professionals and prides itself on leveraging advanced technology, particularly machine learning, to deliver insurance products tailored for the everyday customer. Their approach seeks to address the pain points of traditional insurers, focusing on outdated underwriting methods and payment plans that often exclude those who cannot afford them.

Their offerings are designed with flexibility in mind—customers can choose to pay monthly, quarterly, or annually, ensuring that financial access isn't a barrier to obtaining vital auto insurance coverage. The platform is entirely digital, allowing users to manage their policies, report incidents, and seek assistance seamlessly through an app or their website.

At its core, Momento is about transparency and innovation in insurance. They promise a straightforward experience devoid of the convoluted fine print and complications that often accompany traditional policies. Instead, they use AI to generate customized rates based on a comprehensive understanding of each customer’s risk profile, making the process tailored and fair.

Backed by renowned investors from Y Combinator and Foundation Capital, Momento is positioned to transform auto insurance in Mexico, making it accessible and user-friendly.

**The Mission and Model**

Moni's mission is simple yet profound: to foster group financing for small businesses. With over 44 million small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in Africa, Moni enables groups of entrepreneurs to support one another.

Users can access these services quickly, often in under five minutes, making Moni a go-to platform for SMB financing.

Founded in 2020 and based in Bogotá, Colombia, Mono is a dynamic fintech company designed to simplify financial management for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Latin America. Initially launched as a corporate banking solution, Mono integrates seamlessly with various accounting, tax, and payroll systems, allowing business owners to manage their finances and operations from a single platform. Imagine having your financial house in order without the usual hassle—that's what Mono aims to deliver. 

**Mission and Values**

At its core, Mono's mission is clear: to provide Latin American SMEs with a bank account that centralizes their financial operations. This approach not only saves time but also enhances efficiency, giving business owners more control over their finances. The emphasis on flexibility and reliability speaks volumes about Mono’s commitment to creating a robust infrastructure for its users.

**The Product Suite**

Mono’s offerings are geared towards meeting diverse financial needs:

1. **Corporate Bank Accounts** - Simplifying finance management through integration.
2. **Virtual and Physical Cards** - Users can create multiple cards with customized rules, giving them granular control over spending.
3. **Digital Wallets** - Tailored for partners, these wallets facilitate user transactions, including transfers and balance inquiries.
4. **Payment Solutions** - Include mass payment options to suppliers, real-time client payments via PSE, and a comprehensive API for seamless banking operations.

The product ecosystem is designed for ease of use, with features that allow quick implementation and customization without extensive development time.

**Team and Backing**

Mono operates with a team of 18 people, backed by support from Y Combinator (Batch W22), which adds credibility and exposure in the crowded fintech landscape. Tom Blomfield serves as a Group Partner, providing invaluable insights into the startup's strategic direction.

**Why Mono Stands Out**

What differentiates Mono in the fintech space? It's the blend of flexibility, reliability, and efficiency that the company offers. Mono understands the unique challenges faced by SMEs in Latin America and tailors its solutions accordingly, allowing businesses the freedom to focus on growth rather than getting bogged down by financial administration.

If you're a business owner in Latin America looking for a smarter way to handle finances, Mono is positioning itself as the answer. They’re not just offering services; they’re offering the promise of a streamlined financial future.

Founded in 2019 and based in Panama City, Panama, Munily is an innovative proptech company focused on access control management for gated communities in Latin America. The company emerged from a common challenge faced by many residential complexes: streamlining the entry process for visitors while enhancing communication between security guards, residents, and administrators.

### Problem Solved:
Traditionally, when a visitor arrives at a gated community, the security guard had to manually verify their identity through an unreliable intercom system, often leading to delays and frustration. Munily addresses this by connecting all parties through a dedicated app and tablet. With Munily, the check-in process becomes straightforward:
1. The security guard scans the visitor's ID using a tablet.
2. They select the resident’s apartment, triggering a notification to the resident.
3. The resident can easily approve or deny access through the app.
For added convenience, Munily has even implemented QR codes that visitors can show for quick entry, making the process smoother than ever.

### Features and Functionality:
Munily’s app is more than just a visitor management tool. It includes several modules that cater to different aspects of community management:
- **Security**: Digital records, fast entry via QR codes, panic buttons, and virtual intercoms.
- **Communication**: Mass notifications, resident-to-resident messaging, and administrative voting.
- **Billing and Collections**: Automated billing, reminders for overdue payments, and access to financial reports.
- **Reservations**: Easy management of common area bookings with metrics tracking.
- **Services Marketplace**: Residents can purchase various community services and goods directly from the app.

### Background and Recognition:
Munily is part of Y Combinator's Summer 2022 Batch, a prestigious accelerator that supports early-stage startups. It currently boasts a team of 30 dedicated employees and has gained positive media attention, being recognized for its role in digitalizing community management across Latin America, especially with its recent expansion into Colombia.

To create a luxurious marketplace dedicated to the ultra-wealthy, offering exclusive services and experiences that you simply can’t Google. 

Ultra-high net worth individuals—those with assets exceeding $30 million—spend a staggering $390 billion annually on lifestyle expenses (that’s about $1.3 million per person). Despite this lavish spending, they often find themselves struggling to access the very best in luxury offerings. This is where Myria steps in. It addresses the reality that the finest goods, whether they’re upscale homes, rare boats, or coveted restaurant reservations, typically linger off the public listings and online searches. The wealthiest sellers and service providers don’t need to advertise; they rely on exclusive networks to find their clientele.

Myria serves as a bridge connecting these off-market sellers to the world’s most affluent buyers. It's about leveraging a network of extraordinary people who can access the best of everything—whether for personal pleasure, philanthropic pursuits, or simply to enrich their lives beyond material wealth. To sum it up: if it’s off-market, it’s on Myria.

### What Makes Myria Stand Out:
- **Exclusive Access:** By tapping into a rich network of fortune 500 CEOs, Nobel laureates, Oscar winners, and leading restaurateurs, Myria ensures that its members are not just beneficiaries of luxury services but part of a vibrant community of achievers. 
- **Luxury Lifestyle:** Myria isn’t just about transactions; it’s about creating lasting experiences that bring joy and a sense of accomplishment to its members. When success is redefined as more than just money, Myria helps its clientele measure their achievements by the depth of their happiness and connections.
- **Simplicity and Ease:** The platform offers a seamless experience for users to discover, request, and obtain the extraordinary services they desire without the clutter of the typical online marketplace.

Founded in 2021 and a proud member of Y Combinator Batch W22, Nira Energy is revolutionizing the renewable energy landscape with its innovative mapping tool designed specifically for renewable energy developers. This tool simplifies the process of finding optimal sites for new projects by visualizing available capacity at every interconnection point on the electrical grid.

### Mission

Nira's mission is straightforward: provide software that helps users identify the best locations for renewable energy installations on the electrical grid. By focusing on data-driven insights, Nira ensures developers can maximize their investments and minimize wasted efforts.

### The Nira Tool

Initially launched as a mapping solution, Nira has evolved into a comprehensive platform that allows users to:
- Access capacity data across all substations within a particular region.
- Conduct injection studies at each point of interconnection (POI).
- Enjoy regularly refreshed data that updates automatically as system queues change.

This is especially beneficial for companies like AES and Cypress Creek, who have adopted Nira to streamline their site prospecting process. Customers highlight that using Nira can save them weeks of research by clearly identifying viable sites from the get-go.

### Team and Leadership

Nira Energy is based in [location not specified] and boasts a dedicated team of 20 employees. They are guided by Gustaf Alstromer as their Group Partner, bringing valuable experience and insights to the team.

### Why Nira Matters

In the ever-evolving realm of climate tech and renewable energy, having access to accurate and timely data is crucial. Nira's platform allows developers to avoid spending time on sites with no interconnection capacity, directing focus and resources to locations with high potential. 

Feedback from users speaks volumes: ""Nira has changed the game for prospecting,"" remarks Skye Mooney from AES, emphasizing how the tool has streamlined their site vetting process. Timothy Walsh from Doral Renewables echoes this sentiment, noting the speed and volume of sites they can now evaluate.

Founded in 2021 and set in the vibrant backdrop of New York, Olympian Motors is embarking on a bold journey to reinvent the automotive industry. Armed with an ambitious mission to manufacture modular electric vehicles with style, Olympian is poised to challenge over a century of automotive design norms.

**Innovative Modular Vehicle Design**

At the heart of Olympian’s innovation is their Modular Vehicle & Drivetrain System (MVDS), which resembles a ""Lego-like"" structure. By utilizing a flexible architecture based on four core hardware and two software modules, Olympian has achieved:

- **60% faster production lead times** compared to traditional automakers.
- A staggering **80% reduction in tooling and machinery costs**, giving them a significant edge in efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

This clever engineering is designed to cater to the evolving consumer preferences while addressing traditional manufacturing pain points.

**Market Ambition**

Olympian Motors has set its sights on capturing **7% of the U.S. automotive market by 2030**, effectively disrupting an industry that has seen little change in design philosophy over the last 120 years. They aim to deliver more than just vehicles; they're focused on creating an aesthetic and memorable driving experience, utilizing materials like steel and wood instead of plastics.

**Product Offerings**

Olympian has already made a splash in the market by racking up **214 pre-orders for their Model O1**, translating to over **$17 million** in pre-booked revenue. Operating facilities in Brooklyn and Detroit, they've established a manufacturing capacity of **320 vehicles for 2023**. As they prepare for a commercial launch in Q3 2023, their approach contrasts sharply with competitors, who have taken years to deliver their first vehicles.

The Model O1 and the Model 84 are flagship offerings, showcasing Olympian's commitment to style, sustainability, and performance. Each model boasts impressive ranges and integrates their proprietary **Olympian Operating System** for a seamless user experience.

**Sustainability Focus**

Sustainability plays a critical role in Olympian's ethos. They are committed to using **carbon-sequestered and recyclable materials** for over 4% of their vehicle composites. Their early prototypes demonstrate competitive battery efficiency, outperforming prominent models such as the Tesla Model 3 in urban settings.

In short, Olympian Motors isn’t just about building electric vehicles; it’s about creating a new narrative in transportation—one where aesthetics, functionality, and environmental consciousness are at the forefront. With a focused team of 10 and backed by Y Combinator's Batch W22, Olympian is ready to spearhead a movement redefining how we perceive and experience cars.

At the core of their approach is a groundbreaking method of protein degradation. The company's science is particularly noteworthy; they’re targeting Huntington’s disease as their first indication. Huntington’s, a genetic disorder marked by the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain, desperately needs more effective treatments. Origami has already identified promising small molecules that not only reduce the levels of the harmful mutated protein but also diminish its toxic effects in human neurons—essentially, they're working on how to fix a problem that many thought was “undruggable.”

What sets Origami apart is its focus on “disease-modifying” therapies rather than just symptomatic relief. Their technology aims to tackle multiple neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, suggesting that what they build today might help a wide range of patients tomorrow.

The company operates with a compact yet dedicated team of four employees, reflecting a lean startup ethos that often leads to agile decision-making and creative solutions. They’re leveraging a robust group of partners and advisors to enhance their scientific and commercial strategies, ensuring that they have the guidance necessary to navigate the complex landscape of biotech innovation.

Founded in 2018 and based in Panama City, PayCaddy is on a mission to streamline banking options for businesses throughout Latin America. As part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, PayCaddy offers a robust API platform that allows companies to launch their own financial products without the heavy lifting typically associated with building a fintech from scratch or dealing with legacy banking systems.

#### What They Do

PayCaddy targets businesses looking to develop financial services efficiently. They provide:

- **Digital Wallets**: Enable companies to open digital wallets with built-in KYC checks.
- **Payment Automation**: Facilitate automated online payments to enhance transactional efficiency.
- **Card Issuance**: Offer customizable debit and prepaid cards for customers and employees.

Their solutions are designed for businesses of varying technical abilities, providing a choice between a fully coded solution (Bespoke) and a no-code, white-label offering (Express).

#### Why PayCaddy Stands Out

1. **Targeted Solutions**: Whether you’re in gig work, fintech, retail, or lending, PayCaddy has tools to empower your business—whether you need immediate access to funds, seamless payment options, or card programs.
   
2. **Flexibility**: PayCaddy supports a variety of financial products, including asset-backed cards, USD-backed cards from crypto accounts, and tailored wallets depending on your business structure.

3. **Rapid Integration**: They boast the capability to launch a card issuing program in just weeks, making it a compelling option for businesses eager to roll out financial services without the traditional delays.

4. **Support for Developers**: For tech-savvy teams, there's comprehensive API documentation and a sandbox for testing, making integration straightforward and adaptable to existing systems.

Founded in 2020 and hailing from Bengaluru, India, PayCrunch is tackling a glaring issue in the financial landscape: over 150 million Indians lack access to formal credit due to poor credit scores or insufficient financial data. This startup, part of Y Combinator's Winter 2022 batch, is cleverly leveraging UPI (Unified Payments Interface) to streamline credit access for college students, a demographic often overlooked by traditional financial institutions.

**Mission and Approach**
PayCrunch aims to offer a credit card experience without the baggage of traditional credit checks. They employ alternative credit scoring models, making it possible for users to secure a Pay Later option that opens up financial opportunities for a wider audience—specifically, Gen-Z and college students who desire financial independence but may not have a robust credit history. 

**Why PayCrunch Stands Out**
1. **No Credit Score? No Problem!**: Users can build their PayCrunch score without needing an existing CIBIL score, which is a game-changer for young adults just stepping into the world of finance.
  
2. **Seamless Transactions**: Imagine scanning a QR code and paying later, anytime, anywhere. This convenience aligns perfectly with the fast-paced lifestyle of students today.

3. **Expense Tracking**: On top of facilitating payments, PayCrunch gives users insights into their spending habits, empowering them to manage their finances better.

4. **Community Engagement**: With features like ""PayCrunch shots"" to engage friends and earn rewards, the app creates a social aspect around credit, making it more appealing in a youth-driven marketplace.

### The Vision Ahead
As it continues to grow, PayCrunch aims to redefine what it means to use credit—making it fun, accessible, and tied deeply to the lifestyle of its users. They also plan to roll out additional features, such as the *Super PayCard*, promising to usher in a new age of credit for those ""in a crunch.""

With a lean team of five and strategic partnerships, including prominent backers from the startup ecosystem, PayCrunch is poised to carve out a significant niche in the fintech space. They are clearly not just about credit; they’re about community, empowerment, and making financial tools that resonate with a younger audience.

This ambitious start-up, part of Y Combinator's Winter 2022 batch, aims to tackle some of the most pressing issues of climate change by unlocking much-needed financing.

**What They Do**

Perl Street has already made strides in the world of finance, facilitating over $140 million in debt financing offers for hardware startups from prestigious institutions. Their goal is clear: we need to invest upwards of $4 trillion annually to reach net-zero emissions, and the path forward means innovating and financing new hardware—from energy storage solutions to electric vehicles and smart infrastructures.

Their platform addresses the complexities of financing distributed energy assets by providing a suite of integrated solutions designed to streamline and enhance financial management. Among their offerings are **AssetTrack** for project monitoring, **AssetERP** for financial planning, and other tools that promote efficient integration with existing systems.

**The Problem They Solve**

When we talk about the infrastructure of tomorrow, it needs to be both distributed and resilient. Perl Street recognizes that securing funding for sustainable hardware projects is crucial for achieving these targets. In a time when climate change poses hardware challenges on a global scale, Perl Street is stepping in to ensure that the financial ecosystem can adapt and thrive.

**Their Customers and Impact**

Perl Street proudly supports more than 60 customers globally, rapidly scaling clean energy investments exceeding 14GW. Their customer base includes influential players like King Energy and AMPYR, all benefiting from Perl Street's technology, which transforms how finance teams operate within the renewable energy sector.

**Why Perl Street Matters**

As John Witchel, CEO of King Energy, aptly puts it, ""If Excel is the programming language of finance, Perl Street technology is its operating infrastructure.""

Founded in 2020 and based in Nottingham, UK, Phase Biolabs is on a mission that feels both ambitious and remarkably necessary: they’re converting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into carbon-negative chemicals and fuels through fermentation. Imagine a world where emissions aren’t just a problem to mitigate but a resource to exploit. That’s the innovative vision they’re pursuing. 

As part of Y Combinator's Winter 2022 batch, Phase Biolabs has quickly gained traction, even securing support from Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Foundation through their Innovator Fellowship program. With a nimble team of around 10 talents—engineers, scientists, and creative minds—they’re laying the groundwork for a significant impact in the climate sector.

At the heart of their process is gas fermentation, where H2 and CO2 are fed into specially engineered microbes. These microbes ""eat"" the gases, producing valuable chemicals and electro-fuels. It’s a brilliant twist of biotechnology that essentially aims to end reliance on fossil fuels by retrofitting existing setups to work with any CO2 source. Their goal? Upcycle 1 gigaton of CO2 by 2050. 

The company is not just about big ideas; they’re looking for like-minded individuals to join their mission. The call to arms is clear: “We need your help to achieve our goal and save the planet from harmful emissions.” Interested individuals can check out job opportunities through their website.

**Overview**: Founded in 2021 and based in Berkeley, CA, Phoenix Hydrogen aims to revolutionize the hydrogen market by creating the first commodity marketplace for hydrogen. They're not just any startup; this Y Combinator Batch W22 graduate is stepping into the limelight as the federal government invests heavily in hydrogen infrastructures.

**Mission**: The mission is straightforward yet ambitious—to build a comprehensive marketplace for hydrogen, facilitating efficient trade and distribution. With $9.5 billion in federal grants this year designated for hydrogen grid development, there’s an urgent need for a structured marketplace. Phoenix Hydrogen is uniquely positioned to fill this gap, leveraging existing collaborations with major utilities to establish a robust fulfillment platform.

**Team**: With a compact team of just two, Phoenix Hydrogen demonstrates that big ideas can come from small teams. Spearheading this initiative is CEO Shawn Drost, who brings credible experience to the table, supported by Group Partner Gustaf Alstromer.

**Current Initiatives**:
1. **Hydrogen Marketplace**: They’re developing a dynamic platform that will streamline hydrogen transactions.
2. **Hub Formation Platform**: This aims to facilitate the establishment of high-volume, low-cost hydrogen hubs in partnership with leading energy companies.
3. **Geological Storage**: They are also involved in the development of first-party salt cavern storage assets and orchestration of third-party projects to optimize the hydrogen value chain.

**Recent Highlights**: 
- Phoenix Hydrogen has been making waves by joining the governance board of SHINe, a top DOE H2Hubs consortium, signaling its growing influence in the industry.
- The CEO was recently featured on the ""Scaling Climate Tech"" podcast, discussing how Phoenix Hydrogen is set to be the ""Amazon.com for hydrogen.""

**Opportunities**: The startup is extending leasing opportunities at its undisclosed site, targeting major developers to expedite project development while minimizing costs. The site boasts favorable conditions, including access to water, solar, wind resources, and low-cost hydrogen storage.

**In Summary**: Phoenix Hydrogen is not just building a marketplace; they are laying the groundwork for an entire hydrogen economy.

Remarkably, they already have pilot projects covering over 1,000 hectares (about 2,500 acres) in Germany.

#### Founders
The founders, who met at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM), combine expertise in sustainability science, software engineering, and machine learning. This diverse skill set is vital in crafting tools that promote effective forest management and carbon credit trading.

#### Partnerships and Customers
Pina Earth works with an impressive roster of partners and clients, including notable names like Airbnb, Red Bull, and Polarstern, all of whom value the innovative ways the company enables climate action through carbon credits. The startup has garnered recognition, being awarded the title of “Digital Start-up of the Year 2024.”

#### Current Focus Areas
1. **Forest Owner Engagement:** Educating and enabling forest owners to capitalize on carbon credits.
2. **Credit Buyer Support:** Connecting businesses and organizations looking to purchase carbon credits with local conservation projects.

With a mission to empower 100 million underserved Europeans, especially those in non-Euro countries, Pluto.markets addresses the barriers that have kept many from participating in the stock market. 

Historically, investing has been riddled with high commissions, complex interfaces, and minimum investment hurdles—essentially locking out a massive segment of potential investors. Technology has always played a crucial role in democratizing access to financial markets—think about how the advent of the telephone, the internet, and mobile apps have opened doors. Yet, for the last 30 years, Europe has seen little innovation to address the unique needs of its diverse regions. Pluto.markets is here to change that.

Their platform allows users to create an investment account in just three minutes, offering access to over 3,000 U.S. stocks like Tesla, Nvidia, and Apple, all without commissions. This regulatory framework ensures that investments are safe and backed by the Danish deposit guarantee scheme, protecting users' funds up to €100,000.

The team is small but mighty, consisting of just four dedicated employees under the guidance of their Group Partner, Nan. As they focus on providing a frictionless trading experience with features like fractional shares and auto-invest options, they prioritize transparency—no hidden fees, just an open, clear way to engage with the market. 

Pluto.markets is more than an app; it's a movement toward financial inclusion. By making investing accessible and affordable, they are empowering the ""overlooked regions"" of Europe to seize the investment opportunities once reserved for a select few. With a commitment to innovative solutions, Pluto.markets is on a path to redefine the investment landscape for millions.

Based in San Francisco, Ponyrun operates with a small team of three employees and is on a mission to automate prospect research at scale. It offers a smart solution for sales organizations, enabling them to assess potential leads with ease, whether they’re potential clients or candidates for interviews. 

The platform provides a seamless way to evaluate individuals by simply inputting a search URL or a list of names. By specifying what to look for, Ponyrun leverages artificial intelligence to sift through a candidate's online presence—primarily their LinkedIn profiles—and gather relevant insights to determine their fit for specific sales needs. 

Ponyrun recognizes that time spent on tedious prospecting can drain productivity, so it aims to drastically cut down the hours sales teams typically spend on research. Users report saving significant time—up to three hours a day—that they can redirect toward closing deals rather than getting bogged down in data gathering. 

The company’s tools help users identify relevant prospects and eliminate those who aren’t a good fit, eliminating the waste associated with poor sales leads. It simplifies the outbound sales process, eliminating mass outreach campaigns that often yield dismal results. Instead, Ponyrun focuses on precision prospecting, allowing sales reps to spend time selling rather than searching. 

Early feedback indicates that users find Ponyrun incredibly valuable, with testimonials highlighting a massive boost in meeting booking rates and overall prospecting efficiency.

Radiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.

The acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare!

**Overview**
Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, RedBrick AI is on a mission to transform the landscape of radiology by accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence through high-quality medical data annotation. The company is based in Claymont, Delaware, with a talented team of 13 and additional operations in Bangalore, India. With backing from prominent investors like Y Combinator and Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India), RedBrick AI is primed to tackle a critical issue in healthcare.

**The Problem**
Medical imaging—think CT and X-ray scans—represents over 90% of healthcare data and is crucial for effective medical delivery. However, the growing demand placed on radiology departments around the world has led to a workforce stretched too thin. For instance, in the UK, only 2% of radiology departments can meet their reporting needs, a scenario mirrored globally. This increasing data and demand create an ideal environment for AI intervention, but the challenge remains: there are not enough sophisticated tools to develop and implement AI algorithms effectively.

**What They Do**
RedBrick AI offers a state-of-the-art platform designed to make the process of data annotation faster and more accurate—up to **five times faster** than traditional methods. Their array of services includes:
- **Pixel-perfect annotations**: Tools for tasks like region growing and Boolean operations ensure high-quality data is at hand.
- **Automated segmentation and contouring tools**: Innovations powered by AI assist in precise, ergonomic markings that cater to 2D and 3D annotations.
- **A user-friendly interface**: Customization and shortcuts make it easy for users to adopt their workflows to fit personal needs.

RedBrick AI pulls together these sophisticated features into a single, accessible platform that allows radiologists and researchers to collaborate effectively and maintain strict standards of quality throughout the annotation process.

**Why It Matters**
The implications are profound—speeding up the annotation process not only aids in developing effective AI algorithms but also ultimately enhances patient care by facilitating faster diagnoses and treatment. The platform ensures data security with comprehensive compliance measures, keeping medical imagery safe while giving full control over data usage.

Founded in 2020, this company emerged from Y Combinator's W22 batch and is headquartered in San Mateo, California. With a lean team of four employees, Revoy leverages cutting-edge technology to convert conventional diesel trucks into hybrid-electric systems in just three minutes—without any upfront costs.

The mission? To make trucking not only more profitable but also more sustainable. By adding electric power to diesel trucks, Revoy promises an increase of $25,000 in annual profits per truck and far superior fuel efficiency—three to five times better, to be precise. The approach minimizes downtime by allowing truck operators to swap out depleted electric units at designated stations, significantly faster than traditional EV charging, which can often lead to costly delays.

What sets Revoy apart is its focus on existing fleets. Companies don't have to invest in brand-new electric trucks, which can be prohibitively expensive. Instead, they can transform their current vehicles into eco-friendlier models with immediate savings on fuel and emissions. In fact, each truck can save an average of over $5,000 annually! 

Whether it’s improving road safety with vehicles that boast a 30% shorter stopping distance or straightforward pricing models, Revoy is facilitating a seamless transition toward electrification in an industry that desperately needs it.

**Mission**: Rosebud Biosciences is on a quest to grow micro-organs, or organoids, to discover new drugs that can potentially change lives, especially for children suffering from rare genetic diseases.

### Overview
Founded in 2020 and based in San Francisco, Rosebud Biosciences emerged from the renowned Y Combinator Batch W22. Their innovative approach involves using organoids that replicate the genetic mutations found in patients, thus allowing for more effective drug screening and discovery. The ultimate goal? To find treatments for the 95% of rare diseases that currently lack approved therapies.

### Technology and Approach
Rosebud's unique advantage stems from their organoid platform, which utilizes human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). These ""2.5D"" organoids not only mimic human development but also consist of various cell lineages, facilitating a more accurate model for testing drug efficacy. This allows for the screening of small molecules, RNA therapies, and gene therapies in a fully human biological system. 

Critically, the technology has shown its strength during early validation at Stanford, leading to the discovery of a potential drug target for a pediatric heart disease that traditional models failed to identify.

### Team
Rosebud operates with a lean team of three dedicated professionals:
- **Kitch Wilson**, CEO: A physician-scientist with a rich background in merging hiPSCs with genomic technology.
- **Evan Lyall**, CTO: An engineer-scientist specializing in advanced microscopy and data engineering.
- **Aditya Khedkar**, Senior Scientist: Focused on gene editing and stem cell biology.

### Partnerships and Opportunities
Rosebud Biosciences is actively seeking collaboration with pharmaceutical companies that share their vision for advancing drug development in pediatric diseases. Their organoid platform is perfectly suited for partners interested in developing therapies across a range of conditions, including heart, liver, neural, and kidney diseases.

### Why It Matters
Currently, around 350 million people globally suffer from genetic diseases, with a heartbreaking 30% of affected children not living to see their fifth birthday. Rosebud's pioneering work focuses on reversing this trend by harnessing cutting-edge science to discover treatments for these rare diseases—those that existing approaches have often overlooked.

By building a brighter future for children dealing with rare genetic conditions, Rosebud Biosciences is not just part of a technological revolution in medicine; they are a beacon of hope for families around the world.

Founded in 2021 and made its way through Y Combinator's Winter 2022 batch, Samos Insurance is based in Kitchener, Canada, and operates with a tight-knit team of six. The company's mission? To provide Accidental Death Insurance specifically for individuals undergoing surgery—a pressing need that many traditional insurance policies overlook.

Picture this: Just like travel insurance but specifically constructed for surgical procedures and associated hospital stays. That's the essence of Samos. Their services aim to alleviate stress by offering straightforward, affordable insurance that provides peace of mind when it’s needed most. Whether you’re preparing for an operation or facing the unthinkable during childbirth, Samos is designed to cover the financial anxiety that comes with surgical risks, or as they put it, ""Protect What Matters Most.""

### What Makes Samos Stand Out?

1. **Transparent & Accessible**: The insurance application process is refreshingly quick and free from unnecessary complexity. With no medical exams required, applicants can receive coverage approval in as little as five minutes. This speed is crucial for individuals preparing for surgeries that could be daunting enough without the added burden of financial worries.

2. **Giving Back**: Samos has a philanthropic side, committing to donate 10% of proceeds from all policies sold to the Grand River Hospital Foundation, specifically for the Palliative Care unit at Freeport Hospital. This aligns with their ethos of community support and reinforces their commitment to making a positive impact beyond just insurance.

3. **Unique Offerings**: Their products include Surgical Risk Insurance, tailored precisely for those going under the knife, and Birth Coverage Insurance, designed for expectant parents. This specialization fills a critical gap in the insurance market.

4. **Community Recognition**: Samos has already gained accolades for its innovative approach, including the ""Best Business Innovation"" award at the Canadian SME Awards in 2023 and a ""Carrier/Broker Award"" at Insurtech NY. 

5. **Commitment to Ease**: In a world where traditional insurance can be convoluted and expensive, Samos aims for streamlined access by utilizing advanced data technology to simplify processes.

### Why Choose Samos?

Choosing Samos means opting for peace of mind. It's about knowing that in the face of surgical risks—an unsettling reality for many—you’ll have a safety net. Their focus on straightforward, no-grey-area policies with no hidden fees means you’re not just purchasing insurance; you’re investing in the emotional relief that comes with it.

In summary, Samos Insurance isn’t just another player in the crowded insurance market. It’s a startup that presents a thoughtful approach to a genuine need, embodying both innovation and compassion. It invites those who are considering surgery to protect their loved ones during potentially perilous times—making it a forward-thinking choice in healthcare and insurance.

**Overview:**
Founded in 2018 and based in Santa Clara, CA, Scout is on a mission to unlock digital health in the comfort of your home. The company, a part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, originally identified a gap in the digital health market—diagnostic testing. Their insight was simple yet profound: to expand the potential of digital health at home, access to accurate diagnostic data is crucial.

**The Strategy:**
Scout has developed a smart testing platform, comprising a Hub, test kits, and a user-friendly app. This innovative system achieves remarkable cost efficiencies—10 times lower in development costs and three times lower per-test pricing—while meeting the stringent performance requirements for medical diagnostics. Scout’s technology plugs seamlessly into the existing healthcare ecosystem, aiming to disrupt an outdated $33 billion diagnostic market by making testing accessible and affordable.

**Funding and Validation:**
With $16 million in non-dilutive funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other institutions, Scout has effectively de-risked its platform. The company has already gained FDA authorization for clinical settings, which speaks volumes about their credibility. Their diverse pipeline includes tests for primary care (like respiratory and sexual health), wellness (focusing on gut health), and chronic conditions (such as certain cancers) with plans to launch their flagship Scout Hub in 2024.

**The Technology:**
What sets Scout apart is its precision. Their home testing system boasts a clinical accuracy rate that is 99% as effective as traditional lab tests, allowing for earlier detection of infections compared to standard home tests. With results available in just 30 minutes, it brings lab-grade testing straight to your living room.

**Community Impact:**
Scout not only focuses on technology but also advocates for accessibility—recent initiatives include improving STI testing access for college communities and developing low-cost diagnostics for bacterial infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia.

**Team and Culture:**
With a small, agile team of 12, Scout embodies the startup spirit while being backed by prestigious partners like the NIH and Johns Hopkins University. This lean structure enables rapid innovation and responsiveness to the evolving healthcare landscape.

**In Conclusion:**
Scout stands at the intersection of health tech and consumer empowerment, challenging the status quo and making significant strides in ensuring that everyone has access to quality diagnostic testing at home. As they gear up for their full launch, the company promises to be a transformative force in healthcare delivery.

Their mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to equip ships with the technology to capture carbon emissions effectively. This is crucial in an era where the shipping industry faces increasing pressure to meet new global emissions regulations. 

### The Problem
Shipping contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions, yet shipowners have been limited in their options for compliance and sustainability. Future fuels are still a long way off, and traditional efficiency measures just aren’t cutting it. 

### The Solution
Enter Seabound's retrofittable carbon capture system, which can help vessels reduce CO2 emissions by up to 95%. Their effective design allows for quick installation at minimal capital expenditure (CAPEX), capturing between 25-95% of emissions by converting CO2 into solid, easy-to-store carbonate pebbles. They also provide a streamlined operation: capturing, offloading, and recycling these pebbles at key ports. Simply put, Seabound offers shipowners a proven technology that addresses a pressing challenge today.

### Team & Partners
Seabound is led by co-founder and CEO Alisha Fredriksson, who brings significant experience from her work with maritime startups and climate initiatives. The team consists of nine individuals, including experts in engineering and research, crucial for innovating their carbon capture technology. Their strategic partnerships with firms like Lowercarbon Capital and Eastern Pacific Shipping bolster their credibility and outreach.

### Why It Matters
The stakes are high; shipping drives 90% of the world’s economy. By adopting Seabound’s technology, shipowners can not only comply with upcoming regulations but also position themselves as leaders in the decarbonization of their industry. 

### The Takeaway
Seabound isn’t just a tech company; it's a response to a crucial need in climate action and oceanic sustainability. They're offering a tangible way for the shipping sector to take charge of its carbon output while rethinking its environmental impact.

Suffocation and inaccurate electrocution create stress and so acidify meat, damage quality and significantly reduce shelf-life. 

Artisanal techniques in high-end sushi multiply shelf-life and taste but, because of the variation in fish, are difficult to perform in a mechanical fashion. 

Shinkei automates traditional techniques using robotics to provide long-lasting and delicious fish for farmers and harvesters at scale.",2021.0,[],"**Shinkei Systems: Revolutionizing Seafood Processing with Robotics**

Shinkei Systems, founded in 2021 and based in New York, is on a mission to provide ""Robots for longer-lasting, better-tasting fish at scale."" The problem they’re tackling is profound: every day, 1.2 billion pounds of fish are caught, yet only about one in three reach our plates. Much of this waste comes from fish suffocated on boats or improperly stunned in farms, leading to stress that damages meat quality and shortens shelf life.

What’s key here is the comparison with artisanal sushi practices, which enhance flavor and longevity but are labor-intensive and not easily automated due to natural variability in fish. Shinkei inherits these traditional techniques but supercharges them with technology, using robotics to maintain consistency and quality on a grand scale.

They boast a small but mighty team of nine and operate as part of Y Combinator’s Batch W22. Their focus areas include hardware, robotics, food tech, and agriculture, with an aim to automate fish processing completely. By integrating sensor fusion, edge computing, and machine learning, Shinkei’s platform—called ulmOs—turns data into actionable insights, all while simplifying and reducing labor needs by potentially up to 85%. This not only benefits fishers and farmers economically but also elevates the quality of the seafood we enjoy.

The company’s promise? Significant improvements in product quality—in some cases, chefs can’t even tell the difference between machine-processed and hand-prepared fish.

Skin surface pH is constantly in flux, and many of your daily activities can throw it out of balance. People with chronic skin conditions such as eczema have a harder time regulating their skin's pH. 

Soteri's patented pH/LOCK™ locks skin in at a therapeutic pH for 12+ hours, which is shown to help break the cycle of skin sensitivity, whether you have eczema, psoriasis, or just a bad sunburn.

Our formulations are aesthetically elegant (non-sticky, sit well under makeup, etc), safe for anyone to use, and don't require a prescription. Most people see skin health improvements within the first few weeks of application, even for tricky, chronic skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.

**Overview**  
Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, Soteri Skin is a San Francisco-based Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) skincare brand dedicated to offering a solution for chronic skin conditions, particularly eczema. They’re tackling a huge pain point for the 30 million Americans who suffer from this sometimes debilitating condition.

**Mission**  
Soteri Skin’s mission is straightforward: provide long-lasting relief for eczema and similar skin disorders without needing a prescription. The brand has developed a unique, patented technology known as pH/LOCK™ that stabilizes skin pH to a therapeutic level for over 12 hours, aiming to break the cycle of skin sensitivity related to conditions such as eczema and psoriasis.

**How It Works**  
For people with eczema, maintaining the right skin pH is crucial. Various daily activities can disturb this balance, leading to flare-ups and discomfort. Soteri Skin’s innovative formulations not only restore this balance but also do so without leaving a sticky residue, making them ideal for daily use and even compatible with makeup.

**Product Line and Features**  
Soteri Skin’s range includes:

- **2-Step Eczema Starter Kit**

- **BÉBÉ SKIN Baby Eczema Cream**

These products are designed to be effective for everyone, including children, and customers often report noticeable improvements relatively quickly—typically within a few weeks.

**The Story Behind the Brand**  
Soteri is the brainchild of Rafal, a Harvard-trained Biomedical PhD. His inspiration came from witnessing the struggles of his wife and daughter with eczema and the ineffectiveness of available topical treatments. By diving into the science of skin health, Rafal discovered a critical relationship between skin pH and eczema symptoms, leading to the development of the pH/LOCK™ technology.

**Current Operations**  
Soteri Skin operates with a lean team of two and emphasizes an e-commerce strategy to reach its audience effectively. Their website not only offers product sales but is also a rich resource for information on skincare and the science behind their formulations.

**Conclusion**  
Soteri Skin is making waves in the skincare industry with its unique focus on eczema and its evidence-backed approach to treatment. The combination of innovative science, personal motivation, and a commitment to quality positions them as serious contenders in the skincare market. Anyone looking for reliable eczema relief now has a promising option in Soteri Skin.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from the Y Combinator Batch W22, Spade is a groundbreaking fintech company based in New York. With a nimble team of 13 employees, Spade is on a mission to transform transaction data into actionable insights through its cutting-edge financial data enrichment API.

**Mission and Vision**

The core mission of Spade is to supply enriched transaction data that empowers businesses to make informed decisions. By leveraging a vast, ground-truth merchant dataset, the company helps clients decode tricky transaction descriptions. This not only aids in underwriting and fraud detection but also contributes to constructing a more robust banking infrastructure. In essence, Spade seeks to unveil the hidden truths behind spending habits, providing deep insights that can drive better financial strategies.

**Key Offerings**

Spade’s API offers real-time merchant intelligence, delivering granular details about transactions that can categorize and pinpoint merchant locations accurately. Here’s how their process works:

1. **Data Submission**: Clients send their transaction data to Spade.
2. **Data Enrichment**: The API matches this data with actual merchant identities and classifies it into relevant categories with geolocation specifics.
3. **Fast Returns**: Enhanced and actionable data is returned in mere milliseconds, which is critical for businesses needing quick data processing, especially during card authorizations.

With coverage surpassing 99.9% of U.S. merchants, Spade ensures comprehensive data reliability and accuracy, going beyond traditional codes to identify precise spending patterns and merchant details.

**Why Spade Stands Out**

- **Real-Time Processing**: Transactions are processed in under 50 milliseconds, enhancing speed and efficiency.
- **Ease of Integration**: Developers can set up the solution quickly, sometimes in less than an hour, thanks to its straightforward API architecture.
- **Security**: Spade operates as a SOC 2-certified entity, ensuring the protection of client data amidst robust security practices.

**Trusted Partners**

Spade’s technology is already trusted by customers processing over $100 billion in payments annually. Companies like Stripe, Unit, Mercury, and others leverage its services to enhance their financial operations. 

**Investors and Development Focus**

Backed by prominent investors such as a16z, Flourish Ventures, and Y Combinator, Spade’s financial foundation is solid. The company is heavily developer-focused, emphasizing simplicity and efficiency in its offerings, making it adaptable across various fintech applications.

**Conclusion**

As Spade continues to grow, it stands poised to redefine how businesses understand and utilize transaction data. With an emphasis on precision, speed, and security, Spade is not just another fintech player; it's a pioneer in enriching the way transactions are interpreted and leveraged.

Founded in 2019 and nurtured through Y Combinator's W22 batch, Starling Medical is located in Houston, TX, and is making waves in the healthcare space with its innovative urine diagnostics technology. The mission? To leverage AI and a unique diagnostic platform to enable at-home monitoring of urine health, all while fitting seamlessly into daily bathroom routines.

At the heart of Starling’s offering is **UrinDx™**, a sophisticated device that uses mass spectroscopy to monitor patient health every time they visit the restroom. This device is specifically designed to identify early changes in urinary health, aiming to prevent hospitalizations due to conditions such as recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and diabetes-related issues. 

**How It Works:**
The UrinDx device pairs with a smartphone app to deliver real-time urinary health insights directly to users and their healthcare providers. When it detects concerning changes—like the presence of nitrites that could indicate a UTI—Starling's care team is alerted to reach out, allowing for timely interventions and reducing the need for unnecessary clinic visits.

Starling isn’t just about the tech; it’s also about creating a sustainable model for healthcare providers. By integrating this remote patient monitoring platform, clinicians can diversify their revenue streams through insurance reimbursements without adding to their workload. This makes it a win-win: patients benefit from proactive health monitoring at home, and providers can enhance their care offerings without disrupting their routines.

**The Bigger Picture:**
Starling Medical operates under the understanding that effective healthcare shouldn’t have to come at the cost of convenience or privacy. They prioritize patient data security—ensuring that only the user and their medical teams have access to personal health information, which is crucial in today’s digital age.

With a lean team of five, Starling is ambitious but has the foundational support of strategic partners. The company is poised for growth, not just in Texas but potentially across the nation, as they look to optimize home health diagnostics and pave the way for smarter, more accessible healthcare solutions.

In summary, Starling Medical stands at the intersection of technology and healthcare, harnessing the potential of AI and everyday home life to keep health monitoring simple, effective, and private. Their goal? To prevent hospitalizations with every flush—now that’s a mission worth supporting.

- **Fertility**
- **Parenthood**
- **Cancer**

- One-to-one virtual consultations
- At-home diagnostic tests

### Trust and Recognition
Syrona Health is trusted by partners like NHS, Defra, and several innovative employee benefits organizations.

In summary, Syrona Health is paving the way for a more inclusive healthcare system by providing essential support and resources for women navigating critical health transitions.

**Company Overview:**
Founded in 2018, Torpedo Therapeutics is a Boston-based startup specializing in neurotechnology. As part of Y Combinator's W22 batch, they engage a nimble team of five dedicated employees. Their focus is on developing high-precision, closed-loop neuromodulation devices that enhance the efficacy and adoption of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies.

**Mission:**
Torpedo Therapeutics aims to transform the landscape of neurological disorder treatments by enabling high-precision and closed-loop deep brain stimulation therapy. They are working to refine existing FDA-approved therapies that currently help manage conditions like Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and epilepsy.

**The Problem:** 
Deep brain stimulation has been a lifesaver for many, yet it’s not without its challenges. Current DBS technology often results in off-target stimulation—where the electrodes affect neighboring brain areas, leading to side effects. The existing models also use continuous stimulation without the ability to adapt in real-time to brain activity, necessitating manual reprogramming that can be stressful for patients.

**The Solution:**
Torpedo Therapeutics is addressing these issues through innovative technology. By utilizing micro- and nano-fabrication technologies, they are creating electrodes that are much smaller and thus more precise than their predecessors. These electrodes can stimulate at the level of individual neurons, greatly reducing unwanted side effects while enhancing the therapeutic impact. 

Moreover, Torpedo is developing a closed-loop system that continuously senses brain activity during stimulation. This allows the device to automatically adjust stimulation parameters based on real-time data, reducing the need for patient reprogramming and conserving battery life in their devices.

**Technological Edge:**
Their technology stands out because:
- **High-precision stimulation:** The micro-electrodes are 150 times smaller than current ones, enabling targeted stimulation that minimizes collateral impact.
- **Closed-loop sensing:** This system adjusts stimulation in response to brain activity, vastly improving efficacy and user experience.
- **Automated data analysis:** By employing machine learning, the platform interprets neural data and makes predictive adjustments, which translates into a more tailored patient treatment.

With a mission to enhance the quality of life for those living with neurological disorders, Torpedo Therapeutics is set to make significant strides in the neuromodulation space. To learn more about their ground-breaking work, visit their [website](https://www.torpedotherapeutics.com).

Founded in 2022 and launched through Y Combinator’s W22 batch, Trellus is armed with a mission: to provide real-time coaching for Sales Development Representatives (SDRs). This New York-based startup is on a mission to elevate the sales game by empowering reps with immediate, actionable coaching prompts during their conversations with prospects.

#### The Problem

Sales is a tough game, and hitting quotas can feel like running a marathon without a plan. Many salespeople struggle to engage effectively during calls, where missteps can mean the difference between closing a deal or losing a prospect. That's where Trellus enters the picture.

#### The Solution

Trellus delivers simple yet effective coaching prompts exactly when they’re needed—while sales conversations are happening. Imagine being in the moment and getting nudges like “pause” when you're dominating the conversation or “set next steps” when wrapping up a call. These are not generic tips; they are tailored responses to real-time interactions. The goal? To help more salespeople meet or exceed their quotas faster and with less ramp-up time.

#### The Tech Behind Trellus

Trellus is built by former MIT researchers and leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the learning experience for sales teams. Not just about whispers in their ears, the platform offers analytical tools to track performance and improve skills over time. The tools include:

- **AI Coach**: Provides live feedback on handling objections and competitor positioning.
- **Parallel Dialing & Voice Agents**: Streamlines outbound calls, allowing for simultaneous dialing, and uses AI to simulate customer interactions for training.
- **Sales Floor**: Creates a virtual space for teams to connect, share strategies, and celebrate wins collectively, making remote work feel less isolating.

#### What’s Next for Trellus?

With a compact team of three, Trellus is already making waves in the B2B sales sector. As they continue to refine their approach, their aim is to further reduce barriers to effective communication in sales and transform SDR training into a more dynamic, results-oriented process.

If you’re looking to supercharge your sales team with real-time insights driven by artificial intelligence, Trellus is worth a look. For more information, check out their website: [Trellus](https://www.trellus.ai).

Founded in 2020 and located in the heart of San Francisco, Trusty is a dynamic proptech startup that operates as an innovative agent-to-agent matchmaking network. As part of the prestigious Y Combinator Batch W22, Trusty is on a mission to revolutionize the real estate market by providing ""Limitless Real Estate"" solutions. In a landscape where homebuyers often face limited inventory, Trusty serves as a bridge, connecting agents to exclusive off-market properties, enabling them to discover fresh inventory that isn't visible to the average buyer.

**What Trusty Does**

At its core, Trusty enhances the real estate transaction process with a unique approach: it allows real estate agents to search for homes that may not even be on the market. This capability not only brings new opportunities to buyers looking for their dream homes, but it also creates private offers for homeowners, resulting in a win-win for everybody involved—agents, buyers, and sellers alike. 

The company's smart matching system utilizes advanced AI technology to facilitate searches in natural language. Agents can enter specific buyer preferences, and Trusty's algorithm does the heavy lifting, locating properties that match their clients’ desires. From high ceilings to spacious yards, Trusty ensures that properties are not just matches by criteria but also resonate with the aspirations of the buyers.

**Collaborative Advantage**

Trusty's network emphasizes collaboration among agents; it encourages them to leverage relationships with past clients and tap into each other's insights. By nurturing these connections, agents can turn past buyers into future sellers, thereby creating a continuous cycle of opportunity within their networks.

**Current Status and Team**

With a compact team of six, Trusty is agile and focused. The Group Partner, Aaron Epstein, leads the charge in fostering innovation and growth. The startup's promising framework has already garnered the trust of agents from renowned brokerages like Sotheby's International Realty and Compass, showcasing its credibility and effectiveness in the competitive real estate landscape.

**Why Trusty Matters**

In an industry often hampered by inefficiencies and limited visibility, Trusty emerges as a beacon of opportunity. By tapping into off-market properties and enhancing communication between agents, they’re not just fostering sales; they're nurturing relationships. 

If you’re a real estate agent looking to unlock potential that others can’t see, Trusty might just be the partner you need to thrive in this evolving marketplace. You can learn more about their services or get started through their [website](https://trustyhomes.com).

Founded in 2020 and located in Houston, TX, TYBR Health is at the forefront of medical innovation with a clear and impactful mission: to develop a natural hydrogel that prevents internal scarring after surgery, significantly improving recovery outcomes for patients. As part of Y Combinator's Batch W22, the company embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of turning visionary ideas into transformative solutions.

Every year, millions of Americans undergo tendon and ligament surgeries, and while these surgeries are often necessary, they come with a substantial downside—painful recoveries that can lead to complications like internal scarring. TYBR’s cutting-edge hydrogel is designed to be applied at the end of these surgeries, acting as a protective coating that enhances the body’s natural healing process. This approach not only helps in reducing the complications that arise from scarring but also allows patients to return to their daily lives more swiftly.

Their product is rooted in nature, using a biocompatible material that is free of synthetics. This commitment to harnessing the body's inherent healing capabilities is what sets TYBR apart in the medical devices landscape, which is typically crowded with synthetic solutions.

The company's small but dedicated team of three, supported by their Group Partner Nan, is focused on further developing this product. Despite being a startup, TYBR Health highlights that recovery doesn’t have to mean halting life’s activities; they aim to minimize downtime and maximize the moments that matter. 

While the hydrogel is still under development and not yet available commercially, the vision is bold: to redefine how we think about recovery after intense surgical procedures by making it smoother and more efficient—something that should resonate with anyone who's navigated the lengthy and often painful recovery process after surgery.

With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!

This lean structure allows for agility and rapid iteration, crucial traits for any startup trying to carve out a niche in the tech world. They benefit from the mentorship of Michael Seibel, a notable figure in the entrepreneurial landscape, who serves as their Group Partner at Y Combinator.

WishRoll's mission is clear: they aspire to build something new in the realm of consumer AI. This focus hints at a creative approach to technology—one that could potentially reshape how we interact with our devices and access information. 

The company's characteristics are pretty interesting too; they are tagged with terms like 'social,' 'music,' and, of course, 'New York,' suggesting they may be looking to integrate elements of community, culture, and perhaps even entertainment into their product.

Their guiding philosophy is simple yet compelling: they believe multiplayer games are not just entertainment; they're a vital social good that fosters connection and creativity. By empowering developers, WorldQL aims to maximize joy creation in the gaming community.

Currently operating with a small team of three, WorldQL is spearheaded by Jared Friedman as their Group Partner. They're tagged in the developer-tools and gaming sectors, aligning perfectly with their mission to empower game development.

WorldQL's standout product, Dreamlab, is pitched as the fastest way to bring multiplayer games to life, integrating TypeScript for gameplay scripting along with instant server hosting. Additionally, they offer the WorldQL Server, an open-source 3D database and messaging hub that previously powered their Minecraft scaling solution, Mammoth.

Curiously, their name, ""WorldQL,"" started off as a playful nod to SQL, originally describing a spatial database product. Nowadays, it doesn't stand for anything specific—though they humorously suggest it could mean “World Quantization Labs.”

The company boasts a team of 26 skilled employees, led by visionaries in the hard-tech and satellite sectors. With Aaron Epstein as their Group Partner, they are positioned at the intersection of technology and critical climate needs. Wyvern's imaging technology enables it to provide a groundbreaking spatial resolution of 5.3 meters and features 23 unique spectral bands, making their data invaluable for many applications.

What separates Wyvern from many in the field is their commitment solely to data provision. They are not in the business of selling analytical solutions but focus on delivering high-quality, reliable, and affordable data for clients in various industries, including agriculture, mining, forestry, and defense. Their flagship product, the Dragonette satellite constellation, currently includes three satellites that take daily hyperspectral images of Earth, with plans for many more.

Wyvern is also deeply committed to accessibility and innovation. They've launched an Open Data Program to provide free hyperspectral imagery to expedite research and application testing. This initiative opens doors for businesses, researchers, and decision-makers to address environmental challenges with fresh insights.

If you're grappling with issues like crop classification, invasive species management, or mine reclamation, Wyvern’s hyperspectral data could provide the clarity and precision you need.

Backed by Y Combinator and a team with a solid tech background—including people who’ve worked at Facebook and WhatsApp—Yezza is carving its niche in a market that's ripe for innovation.

As of now, Yezza boasts an impressive monthly recurring revenue of $40K, driven by around $3 million in monthly gross merchandise volume (GMV) from approximately 1,500 daily orders. The business is not just financially healthy; it’s profitable—a rare feat for startups today. Merchants pay a modest subscription fee of $12 per month, plus a fee of up to $0.25 per order. Considering the 50 million downloads of WhatsApp Business in the region, Yezza believes it’s operating within a staggering $7.2 billion market opportunity.

The platform began by allowing small businesses to sell goods, but it's expanded to suit various use cases in WhatsApp Commerce. For instance, social media influencers now leverage Yezza to negotiate deals with brands, while customers make reservations at restaurants—all through WhatsApp.

Founded in 2020 and rocking the Y Combinator Batch W22, Yhangry is based in London, UK. It’s not just another food delivery service; it’s a private chef marketplace that has made it effortless to book a talented chef right to your home for various occasions.

**The Concept**: Yhangry offers a seamless solution to anyone wanting to socialise over a home-cooked meal. For approximately $40 per person, patrons can secure a three-course feast—with minimal clicks. Think of it as taking the restaurant experience up a notch: instead of navigating crowded spaces, you get fine dining in the comfort of your own home. 

On the flip side, it’s a lucrative path for chefs. Yhangry helps culinary professionals earn up to three times more than typical restaurant roles, creating a win-win scenario.

**How it Works**:
1. **Personalised Experience**: Users specify their preferences, vibe, and budget. 
2. **Curated Quotes**: Within about 20 minutes, clients receive tailored menus and quotes from various chefs.
3. **Customisation**: After booking, customers can still tweak their menus through direct chats with their chef.

**Diverse Offerings**: The platform is a treasure trove for food lovers. Whether you're hosting a birthday party, wedding, or a casual get-together, the chefs create bespoke menus tailored to individual tastes. The options range from vegan meals, international cuisines, fine dining experiences, to kid-friendly menus—there’s something for every palate.

**Why Choose Yhangry?**
- **Vetted and Rated Chefs**: Each chef comes with a transparent rating and review system, ensuring quality.
- **Secure Payment**: All payments are safely held until the event, minimising risk.
- **Insurance**: Public liability insurance covers any mishaps during the chef’s service.
- **Flexible Policies**: Yhangry offers easy cancellation procedures and a dedicated support team.

With a team of 12, under the guidance of Group Partner Michael Seibel, and a growing clientele of over 40,000 customers, Yhangry is on a mission to redefine dining experiences—one event at a time.
