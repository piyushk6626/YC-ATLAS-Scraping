,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"1849 bio designs microbes enabling cheap metal extraction allowing miners to unlock value from low quality copper and gold ores. Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. 

Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can’t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.

While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. 

To change that, we’re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.

Founded in 2024 and based in San Francisco, 1849 Bio is an ambitious biotech start-up that's tackling a dramatic gap in the metals market. With the electrification wave driving a surge in demand for key metals like copper, there’s an expectation of a 20% supply shortfall in the next few years. This is where 1849 Bio steps in with a mission: engineering microbes that help miners extract valuable metals from low-quality ores, thereby unlocking billions of dollars in trapped resources. 

At present, conventional mining processes for metals come with hefty price tags—running about $7 per ton of ore. Biomining, however, operates at approximately $1 per ton. The catch? Biomining techniques can only apply to about 20% of copper ores, leaving an estimated $800 billion worth of copper stranded in waste materials due to unprofitable extraction methods. This is a gold mine of a problem, and it presents a significant opportunity.

While there has been intensive work on refining the mining processes, the microbes themselves have largely been overlooked. That’s where 1849 Bio’s expertise comes into play. The team's founders—Jai Padmakumar, Yongjin Park, and Nicholas DeLateur—are world-class microbial engineers who met during their PhDs in synthetic biology. They are uniquely positioned to change the game by developing custom engineered microbes that improve the efficiency of biomining.

With the backing of Y Combinator (Batch S24) and a small but focused team of three employees, 1849 Bio is not only committed to innovation in metal extraction but is also aiming to do so in an environmentally friendly way. It's a blend of hard-tech, synthetic biology, and climate consciousness, all while redefining what it means to do mining sustainably.

In summary, 1849 Bio is working on transforming the mining landscape with biotech advancements, paving the way for a more efficient and eco-friendly means of extracting key metals, all while addressing the looming supply issues that electrification is bringing to the forefront.

Founded in 2024 and part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, Arva AI is on a mission to revolutionize how banks and fintechs handle business verification. By deploying AI agents to automate the know your business (KYB) verification process, Arva achieves what once took human analysts days in just seconds.

#### The Problem
Traditionally, onboarding a business at a bank or fintech involved meticulous manual document checks, resulting in operational delays and ballooning costs. Approximately 30% of these KYB cases ended up needing further manual review, straining resources and increasing the risk of human error.

#### The Solution
Enter Arva AI. They offer a suite of AI-enabled tools designed to automate nearly the entire onboarding process. This not only speeds up the experience—resulting in **instant onboarding** for businesses—but also reduces operational costs by approximately **80%**. The potential market opportunity is significant, with estimates of a **$24 billion** market in the U.S. alone.

#### Key Features
1. **Deep Online Due Diligence:** Enhances KYB checks with rich online data, minimizing the need for excessive information.
2. **Website Analysis:** Continuous monitoring allows for the detection of fraudulent activities through automated website assessments.
3. **Document Intelligence:** Vision AI assists in identifying document fraud while simplifying data processing.
4. **Real-time Customer Communication:** Builds a more efficient onboarding experience by reducing information back-and-forth.
5. **Global Data Enrichment:** Accesses business registry data from over 150 countries, allowing for seamless international onboarding.

#### Why Arva?
With slow customer onboarding costing the fintech industry an estimated **$10 billion** in lost revenue annually, Arva empowers companies to operationalize compliance while focusing on high-risk investigations rather than drowning in paperwork.

If you're in healthcare or even just someone who has navigated the labyrinth of patient records, you’ll understand the struggle. Enter *Codes Health*, founded in 2024 and emerging out of Y Combinator's S24 batch. With a mission aimed at creating perfect medical histories, Codes Health aims to eliminate the chaos of scattered documents across electronic health records (EHRs), providers, and faxes. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, they compile and analyze necessary documents into cohesive patient histories that are easy to access and understand.

Based in New York, Codes Health operates with a lean team of three—yes, just three folks pushing a big idea. Their offering serves both healthcare providers and lawyers, aligning clinical needs with legal documentation in a seamless service. The company focuses on pulling live patient documentation from major health information exchanges, gathering records from previous providers, and even processing patient-held files. It’s an efficient way for both practitioners and patients to manage medical history, reducing time and improving accuracy.

One standout feature? Their digital intake and release of information (ROI) process helps ensure that patients can complete their release forms correctly—right from their phones. They even verify provider information to eliminate common entry mistakes and provide real-time updates for requests, acting almost like the most diligent assistant your backoffice could dream of.

Codes Health is tagging itself as part of the *health-tech*, *B2B*, *legaltech*, and of course, *AI* sectors—demonstrating their aim to revolutionize how medical information flows in the digital age.

Founded in 2025 and based in San Francisco, Dench.com aims to revolutionize the way law firms handle lead qualification. Think of them as an AI-powered secretary specifically designed to pre-qualify leads for legal practices, particularly high-volume ones. Originally known as Our Voice, this startup is backed by notable investors like Y Combinator (Batch S24), Founders X Ventures, and Pioneer Fund, having recently raised a $1 million seed round.

At its core, Dench.com employs artificial intelligence to streamline client screening processes, ensuring law firms never miss a potential lead. With just a small team of two, the company is punching well above its weight. They’ve already qualified over 60,000 leads through their innovative AI agents, which handle initial client interactions with remarkable efficiency.

### The Problem They're Solving

Law firms often face inefficiencies in lead intake, leading to missed opportunities and high costs. Dench's AI secretary resolves these issues in several compelling ways:

1. **24/7 Availability**: Unlike a human counterpart restricted to business hours, Dench’s AI can answer calls instantly at any hour, ensuring every lead is attended to without delays.
  
2. **Cost Efficiency**: One human secretary can cost upwards of $48,000 annually. Dench’s AI service operates at a fraction of that cost—charging just $0.99 per minute.

3. **Scalability**: While a human can handle only one call at a time, Dench’s AI can manage unlimited concurrent calls simultaneously, effectively multiplying a firm’s capacity to engage with potential clients.

4. **Data Accuracy and Consistency**: The AI consistently follows the firm’s intake protocols, collecting vital information from callers with 100% accuracy—something traditional human staff often struggle with.

### Their Services

Dench.com caters to various legal sectors, including personal injury, family law, criminal defense, and immigration. Their AI not only pre-qualifies leads but also schedules appointments and routes urgent matters to attorneys—expediting the entire process.

- **Personal Injury**: Fast and efficient case detail gathering.
- **Family Law**: Empathetic initial screenings done in just minutes.
- **Workers' Compensation**: Captures critical details while they’re fresh.
- **Bankruptcy and Immigration**: Both services benefit from quick assessments and multilingual capabilities.

### Testimonials

The effectiveness of Dench’s service is highlighted by feedback from clients such as Kevin Perkins, founder of Vanacour Perkins PLLC, who praises how Dench transformed his law firm’s intake process while maintaining a human touch.

Taylor Willingham, founder of The Willingham Law Firm, echoes this sentiment, stating that Dench has drastically reduced the costs associated with lead qualification, allowing them to focus more on client work rather than administrative tasks.

### Conclusion

In summary, Dench.com is not just another tech startup; it’s a game-changer for law firms looking to optimize their lead qualification process. By leveraging AI to provide immediate, accurate, and cost-effective client interactions, Dench stands ready to transform the legal landscape, one lead at a time. If you’re in the legal sector and looking to enhance your intake process, exploring what Dench has to offer could prove to be a smart move.

**Overview**  
Dodo, founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch S24, is based in San Francisco. The company is on a mission to enhance the efficiency of specialty clinics through AI-powered employees, initially focusing on the veterinary sector. Currently, the team consists of three dedicated members.

**Mission and Product**  
Dodo aims to be the first AI receptionist for veterinarians, handling various front and back-office tasks to allow clinics to operate 24/7. Their AI system autonomously manages client communications, answers calls, sends medical records, refills prescriptions, and more—all without human intervention. This not only boosts a clinic's revenue potential (by over $100k) but also alleviates the burdens of repetitive tasks for staff.

Think about it: veterinary clinics, like many others, run into the problem of missed calls and slow response times. Dodo flips that script with its AI solution, ensuring that client inquiries are met with prompt, accurate responses. They’ve built a system that learns from the specific protocols of each clinic, effectively becoming a customized assistant to fit each practice's needs.

**Key Features**  
- **24/7 Availability:** Ensures no client inquiry goes unanswered.
- **Client Communication Handling:** Captures and addresses various inquiries seamlessly.
- **Administrative Task Automation:** Frees human employees from basic tasks, allowing them to focus on patient care.
- **Integration with Existing Tools:** Offers open APIs and frameworks for seamless integration with clinic management software.

**Current Progress and Backing**  
Dodo is positioned in various sectors, such as healthcare IT, call centers, and conversational AI. The company is supported by Gustaf Alstromer as their Group Partner at Y Combinator. With the average turnover rate for veterinary receptionists at 32.5%, Dodo offers a solution that enhances efficiency and reduces staffing challenges.

**Future Directions**  
Dodo is still in the early stages but has set a precedent in the realm of veterinary care and AI integration. The ambition is clear: to refine AI capabilities to not just answer phones, but to enrich the overall experience for both clinics and pet owners. They envision a world where administrative headaches vanish, freeing clinics to focus exclusively on patient care.

**Conclusion**  
Dodo represents a significant leap forward in the way veterinary clinics can manage operations. By harnessing AI and tapping into industry-specific knowledge, they're setting the stage for a future where veterinary practices can thrive without the typical constraints of operational inefficiencies.

**Foundation and Mission**  
Founded in 2023, Domu Technology Inc. is a cutting-edge startup based in San Francisco, specialized in automating debt collection calls for banks using generative AI. Their mission? To streamline and enhance the way financial institutions handle debt collections and sales calls, making the process more efficient and effective.

**Performance and Growth**  
In just under a year, Domu has made significant strides, achieving an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $870k. They count noteworthy clients among their roster, including major players like BBVA, BNP Paribas, and Skandia. Their ability to tailor services to the nuances of the financial sector sets them apart.

**The Team**  
Domu operates with a nimble team of five employees, which is quite impressive considering the scale of results they’re producing. Their involvement with Y Combinator's Batch S24 adds a layer of credibility and support that’s crucial for early-stage startups.

**Technology and Impact**  
At the heart of their offering is the ability to perform human-like voice calls for both the insurance and financial industries. Domu’s generative AI technology allows for 24/7 automation of sales and debt collection calls, engaging with potential clients in real-time right after they express interest—think of it as having your best sales agents operating around the clock.

**Addressing Key Challenges**  
Domu tackles significant pain points faced by businesses today. With statistics showing that 70% of companies don’t meet their sales goals due to a lack of actionable data, and a staggering 85% of customers abandoning a purchase after receiving a quote online, the need for their service is clear. Traditional call rates are dismally low, with only 14% of clients picking up the phone. Domu aims to change that narrative by optimizing outreach efforts in a way that generates results.

**A/B Testing and Real-Time Engagement**  
What’s particularly compelling is Domu’s capability to perform extensive A/B testing—over 100 experiments per client monthly. This agility not only helps improve engagement but ensures that strategies evolve based on data-driven insights. The technology allows calls to be triggered based on customer interactions with websites, emails, or ads, significantly enhancing the chances of conversion.

### Success Stories  
Domu’s approach has already borne fruit:

The company’s mission is straightforward: provide developers with a comprehensive platform to build, use, and monetize these agents without getting bogged down by the underlying complexities. 

Think of it like this: if you're a developer, you can concentrate on crafting the tools your agents need, while Doublezero takes care of the heavy lifting—think reasoning frameworks, state management, analytics, monetization, and an intuitive user interface for managing these agents. It’s designed for simplicity and power, allowing users to start, stop, rewind, and even intervene in real-time with the agents they create.

The platform's architecture is solid. It offers robust functionality: from observing and thinking to deciding and executing—essentially everything your autonomous agents need to thrive. Developers can create their own tools via API routes and leverage an extension library to enhance their agents' capabilities. Moreover, you can track everything that matters—performance metrics, costs, insights for optimization—all in one dashboard.

Doublezero's platform also features a marketplace for tools and agents, making it quick and easy to find community-driven resources. This not only accelerates the development process but also opens up monetization pathways, allowing developers to earn from their creations.

With a compact team of just two employees and the backing of Garry Tan as their Group Partner, Doublezero is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for autonomous agents. It positions itself as a vital player in a future where these intelligent systems will likely become commonplace.

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, DreamRP is on a mission to “Bring your characters to life.” Located in San Francisco, this startup aims to revolutionize how fans interact with their favorite fictional characters through chatbots. 

Initially, DreamRP allowed users to engage with character chatbots created by the content owners, meaning fans could chat with a Jon Snow bot designed by George R. R. Martin himself. This model taps into a significant trend: character chat is rapidly becoming one of the most engaging social experiences available—surpassing platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.

However, the market is currently flooded with fan-made knock-offs that operate without deals from the original content owners. That’s where DreamRP steps in, crafting a fully legal character chat platform that not only respects intellectual property but also shares revenue with the content owners. This unique approach is likely to attract both creators and fans alike, offering a win-win situation.

DreamRP is currently a lean operation with just two employees, and they are nurtured by Jared Friedman as their Group Partner. The company's focus on artificial intelligence, generative AI, and entertainment aligns tightly with emerging trends in the consumer space, setting the stage for potential growth and innovation.

As DreamRP continues to develop its platform, it bridges the gap between character-driven storytelling and interactive technology, heralding a new era for fans and creators.

Founded in 2023 and currently part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Drillbit emerged from a clear need: residential contractors were overwhelmed with administrative tasks that bogged them down. The company, with just a team of two, is tackling this headache head-on by automating office work for contractors.

**The Solution: All-in-One Automation**

Drillbit combines technology and artificial intelligence to streamline operations. Here’s what they offer:

- **AI Receptionists**: Every missed call becomes a structured lead, managed by AI agents who qualify the lead and log it into the CRM.
- **Rapid Quoting**: Their LLM-based quoting tool transforms brief job descriptions into detailed, editable quotes in seconds. This means less time typing and more time doing.
- **Integrated Payments**: Once a job is completed, Drillbit can request payment directly from clients, even following up automatically if needed—making cash flow smoother.
- **Job Opportunity Alerts**: The platform analyzes job history to identify new opportunities and can even reach out to clients on the contractor's behalf, if allowed.

**Time is Money**

At its core, Drillbit’s mission is to help contractors regain their time so they can focus on what really matters—growing their business and nurturing client relationships. The tagline “Get half your day back” encapsulates this perfectly. By automating mundane tasks, Drillbit allows contractors to spend more hours in the field or enjoying life outside of work.

**Meet the Founders**

Drillbit is co-founded by Alex and Liam, who previously worked in developing robots for industrial projects. Alex's personal experience in renovations illuminated the need for better software in home services, leading him to call Liam and start this venture.

Founded in 2024 and based in San Francisco, Educato AI is carving out a significant niche in the edtech world. With the mission of being an AI-powered worldwide exam preparation platform, it’s targeting a gap that has long been neglected: quality online prep material for exams taken by hundreds of thousands of students globally—not just the top exams in the U.S.

You see, online exam prep tools have been around for decades, but they’ve primarily focused on a mere handful of well-known American exams. Educato aims to change that narrative by leveraging AI to create high-quality, tailored content for a broader array of examinations. This includes everything from national exams in Romania to service exams in the Philippines and civil service exams in Nigeria. By tapping into the ""fat middle"" of the exam distribution—a segment often ignored by educational companies—Educato is enabling students to access personalized learning experiences that cater to their needs.

Currently a part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, Educato is backed by a team of three, with Tom Blomfield (famed for his work with Monzo) as their group partner. The platform doesn’t just stop at creating study materials; it emphasizes an engaging learning experience through features like recap tests and logical reasoning questions. In a world where rote memorization has been the norm, Educato is refreshing—offering a platform that emphasizes understanding over memorization.

As of now, Educato is live and supporting a variety of exams, including the ASVAB, Bar Exam, NCLEX, and even international markers like the UPSC exams in India and the Baccalauréat in France. There's also a roster of upcoming examinations, continually expanding its reach.

As the AI Executor, we manage the entire estate transfer process, facilitating $3 trillion in wealth transfers annually, with a ~3% take rate.

Adria experienced this challenge firsthand after her mom passed away, leaving her to settle the estate while balancing her career. The process is currently entirely manual and takes an average of 400 hours over 18 months. Adria eventually burned out and resigned, which is when she realized that bereavement costs businesses $100 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and attrition.

By addressing this problem through businesses, Elayne generates recurring revenue in an industry traditionally reliant on 1x transactions, while maintaining a lasting presence in the end user’s life.

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Elayne is on a mission to change how families manage estate planning and settlements after death. With its innovative platform, Elayne aims to empower families to build generational wealth and simplifies the estate transfer process, which currently bogs down millions of people for an average of 400 hours over 18 months. Think about that – 400 hours of stress, paperwork, and emotional strain. 

The story behind Elayne came from a personal experience. Adria, the founder, faced the burden of settling her mother's estate while juggling her career. The weight of those responsibilities led her to a breaking point, illuminating a broader problem that costs businesses around $100 billion annually due to lost productivity when employees experience bereavement. 

**The Opportunity**

Elayne is positioned in a market dealing with over $3 trillion in annual wealth transfers, where the traditional model relies on one-time transactions. Instead, Elayne introduces a recurring revenue model that turns estate planning into an ongoing service rather than a tedious task done once and forgotten. The company aims to reduce the average attrition rate, which spikes by 43% following a family member's death. It provides substantial cost savings for grieving families by automating financial, legal, and administrative tasks, thereby giving them back hundreds of hours of precious time.

**Who It Serves**

Elayne services both employers and individuals or families. For families, the platform offers valuable solutions from creating estate plans to providing support during the aftermath of loss. Employers can utilize Elayne to enhance employee benefits, providing crucial support during difficult times, which in turn aids in retaining talent and improving workplace morale.

**How It Works**

Elayne leverages AI-driven tools to provide personalized, smart estate planning. Family members can join the platform for free, ensuring that everyone stays aligned. Users can upload documents and receive assessments regarding their estate's readiness, while a dedicated human concierge guides them through post-loss complexities. This comprehensive approach is designed to minimize the burden during life’s most challenging moments.

**Security and Privacy Matters**

In an era where personal data is prized, Elayne is committed to security and privacy, adhering to strict standards like SOC II and HIPAA while ensuring secure data encryption and multi-factor authentication.

**Why It Matters**

Addressing such a sensitive area of life with empathy and efficiency could make all the difference for families encountering hardship. Elayne doesn't just offer a service; it's a solution to a societal problem. Navigating loss is never easy, but with Elayne, it doesn’t have to be an insurmountable challenge.

Founded in 2024 and located in the bustling heart of New York, FINNY AI serves a definitive mission: to be the operating system for independent financial advisors. The brainchild of a four-person team, FINNY initially entered the stage as simply ""FINNY,"" focused on tackling an existential problem for advisors: growth.

**The Challenge: Inefficiency in Growth**

Independent financial advisors face a daunting challenge. To onboard just one new client, they can expend up to 60 hours in business development. It’s a high-stakes game filled with noise and missed opportunities. FINNY AI believes that with the power of artificial intelligence, they can turn this tide.

**The Solution: AI-Driven Client Prospecting**

FINNY AI's platform harnesses the vast expanse of data to empower financial advisors in ways that were never possible before:

- **Prospect Identification**: Advisors can tap into thousands of data points to identify leads within their target niche. FINNY monitors life events—like a job change or marriage—that often trigger the need for financial advice.
  
- **Prospect Prioritization**: Using a unique scoring system dubbed the F-Score, prospects are ranked based on their conversion likelihood, tailoring the approach to each advisor’s specific clientele.

- **Automated Outreach**: FINNY AI takes on the heavy lifting by managing outreach efforts. Whether it's selecting the best channel or crafting personalized messages, the platform allows advisors to book meetings with interested clients efficiently.

This trio of capabilities means that financial advisors can focus on what they do best: nurturing client relationships.

**Backed by Y Combinator**

As part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, FINNY AI recently celebrated a successful $4.3 million seed funding round, affirming its model and vision. Notably, it's on the radar of industry leaders and has received accolades for its innovative approach, including being named ""Best in Show"" at the 2024 Fintech Showcase.

**Empowering the Independents**

At its core, FINNY AI champions independent financial advisors, aspiring to help them provide essential financial services to all Americans. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, they hope to cut through the noise of traditional prospecting methods and create an ecosystem where growth is not just a goal but a given.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"Hi - Mark and Gab here!

We met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, where we built a $200 million specialty finance business line. At Alt, we faced the complex challenges that come with servicing consumer loans. We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance—all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.

However, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.

So, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had—an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. Our mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience.
So, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.

Finsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.

#### Mission

Finosu is on a mission to streamline workflow automation in the credit industry. Their primary goal is to create a consumer loan servicing experience that is efficient, compliant, and customer-centric, transforming an often cumbersome process into something seamless.

#### Founders’ Journey

Finosu was founded by Mark and Gab, who first crossed paths while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles. There, they built a $200 million specialty finance business, grappling with the challenges of managing consumer loans. They quickly realized the inadequacies of existing systems—manual data entry, fragmentation, and poor engagement were just a few pain points they faced.

This led them to envision Finosu as the solution they wished they had during their tenure at Alt. They aimed to create an AI-powered servicer that would not only alleviate these frustrations but also enhance the overall loan servicing experience for both lenders and borrowers.

#### Key Offerings

Finosu provides a comprehensive suite of software designed to reduce barriers in lending. Some of their core offerings include:

- **Outsourced State Licensing**: Simplifying the regulatory landscape for lenders.
- **Default Compliant Loan Management Systems**: Ensuring robust management and compliance across loan servicing operations.
- **Automated Servicing Infrastructure**: Utilizing AI to facilitate seamless, automated communication channels including voice, text, email, and direct mail.

This approach not only aims to improve the borrower experience but also significantly cut down on operational costs, addressing a fundamental issue where servicing can cost lenders billions annually.

---

#### What Sets Finosu Apart?

Finosu differentiates itself with a focus on:

- **Comprehensive Compliance**: 100% compliance coverage, with real-time monitoring for customer escalations and potential violations, ensuring peace of mind for lenders.
- **Easy Integration**: The platform easily integrates with existing Loan Origination Systems (LOS), Loan Management Systems (LMS), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools, making it adaptable for various operational needs.
- **Customer-Centric Approach**: With a commitment to enhancing borrower experiences, Finosu seeks to provide more personal engagement, improving recovery rates while maintaining satisfaction.

Located in San Francisco and part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, the company is poised to reshape how banks and fintechs handle compliance operations using AI.

**Mission and Vision**  
Focal’s mission is straightforward yet ambitious: to automate compliance, risk, and dispute operations for financial institutions. The founders, Ray Morgan and Katia Bazzi, both former Stripe executives, witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies in manual reviews cutting across the banking sector. They’re tackling a pressing challenge that many in finance face—balancing human resources against increasing demands from fraud, regulatory scrutiny, and operational inefficiencies.

**The Problem**  
As the regulatory landscape grows more complex, financial institutions are relying heavily on human reviewers to comb through activities. This not only leads to slow turnaround times but also increases the likelihood of errors. Often, good accounts get falsely flagged, while harmful ones slip through the cracks. Focal aims to change this by integrating AI into these workflows, reducing reliance on humans for tasks that, while clearly defined, don’t necessarily translate well to traditional software solutions.

**How It Works**  
Focal automates repetitive tasks while seamlessly integrating with existing operational frameworks. It learns from a business's unique playbooks and employs browser automation to collect critical information from various sources. This not only aids human agents in making informed decisions but helps eliminate common errors—effectively streamlining operations and boosting efficiency.

**Founders and Support**  
Ray Morgan, who led payments engineering at Stripe as it ballooned from $5 billion to over $500 billion in volume, and Katia Bazzi, who was instrumental in launching several new Stripe products, lead Focal. They’re supported by notable backers like General Catalyst and Y Combinator, which signals strong confidence in their vision.

In essence, Focal is not just another tech startup; it’s addressing real pain points in financial operations with cutting-edge solutions aimed at transforming compliance processes from cumbersome to streamlined. With a small team of just two but a big idea, they’re set to make waves in the financial industry.

My co-founder and I are building a new cloud and backend workflow so that we and others can build exceptional software in a fraction of the time."", 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobzwang/'}]","**Freestyle: Simplifying Infrastructure with JavaScript**

Freestyle is an ambitious startup founded in early 2024 by Ben and Jacob, two high school friends who stumbled upon the world of tech during a Calculus class. Their journey in entrepreneurship began back then, and although their first attempt went nowhere, it laid the groundwork for their future endeavors. Fast forward, Ben led the frontend development of the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 app while Jacob later joined Apple, eventually inviting Ben to the tech giant as well. They spent a productive two years at Apple’s Conversational Engineering Department, learning valuable lessons from the tech they worked with, which ultimately sparked the inspiration for Freestyle.

Located in San Francisco and part of the Y Combinator Batch S24, Freestyle is on a mission to build exceptional infrastructure using only JavaScript. This small yet driven team of five aims to empower developers by leveraging native JavaScript APIs to streamline web development. With a clear focus on enhancing developer tools, Freestyle challenges the typical reliance on multiple external services for functionalities like database management and authentication.

Freestyle introduces a concept that they call ""TypeScript is the Database,"" allowing developers to structure their applications with simplicity and elegance. By using the @cloudstate decorator, properties of classes can be persistently stored and accessible across any request, paving the way for efficient coding and deployment.

What makes Freestyle truly stand out is its commitment to open-source collaboration. Rather than introducing opinionated APIs that complicate development, they leverage existing ECMAScript standards, empowering developers to use what they already know. This enables them to replace external services—like Auth0 or traditional database systems—with versatile, built-in APIs that are easy to use and integrate.

In a world brimming with boilerplate code and cloud complexities, Freestyle offers a refreshing alternative: ""Deploy your entire stack in 1 command."" By prioritizing native TypeScript APIs, developers can focus on business logic without getting bogged down by infrastructure concerns. 

If you're curious about their offerings, you can dive into their documentation, join their community on Discord, or even explore their open-source projects on GitHub. Freestyle is positioning itself as a leading edge in developer tools—a place where your JavaScript skills can truly shine.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"The rise of weaponized drones has fundamentally transformed security threats both in warfare and civilian contexts. In Ukraine, $500 modified commercial drones regularly neutralize million-dollar military assets. At our southern border, cartels use drones to smuggle fentanyl and survey law enforcement positions. Critical infrastructure, military bases, and correctional facilities face unprecedented vulnerability to unauthorized surveillance and drone-based attacks.

Founded in 2024, GuardianRF develops advanced RF spectrum sensors to protect against this evolving threat landscape. Our technology has been battle-tested in Ukraine, where consumer drones converted into precise guided missiles have become a daily reality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on regulatory compliance, our sensors can detect modified and non-Remote ID compliant drones from up to 3 km away, accurately pinpointing both drone and operator locations.

What sets us apart is our distributed mesh network of sensors combining advanced Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology with AI-driven signal classification. Trained on extensive combat zone datasets, our system processes RF signatures in real-time across multiple frequency bands, catching even sophisticated stealth drones using frequency-hopping protocols. When a threat is detected, the system delivers precise targeting data while maintaining continuous tracking.

Our product line includes:
- Scout Detector: A handheld drone detector for rapid deployment and portability
- Mosaic Sensor Network: A scalable mesh network of RF sensors for detecting, tracking, and mapping drone activity across expansive areas

The stakes are severe: along our borders, cartel drones facilitate trafficking that costs thousands of lives annually. In prisons, a single successful drone contraband delivery can trigger facility-wide violence. For critical infrastructure, a coordinated drone strike could cause billions in business interruption losses. Traditional drone defense systems, often priced in the millions, are cost-prohibitive for most organizations.

GuardianRF bridges this critical gap with accessible, effective protection. Our AI classification engine recognizes various control protocols including modified ExpressLRS, Crossfire, and DJI variants, providing early warning of threats that traditional systems miss entirely. The system's fully automated detection, tracking, and response mechanisms ensure continuous protection with minimal operational overhead.

Built and manufactured in the United States, GuardianRF combines field-proven technology with real-world deployment experience to counter modern drone threats.

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Helium is on a mission to create self-improving software that intelligently optimizes user experiences to boost revenue. Think of it as an AI that’s not just smart, but constantly learning and adapting to better serve users and businesses alike.

The company kicked off its journey by partnering with a social app boasting 20 million monthly active users (MAU), helping them test and refine their in-app paywalls to enhance subscription rates. It’s a smart approach—by experimenting on key moments in the user funnel, Helium aims to turn casual users into loyal subscribers with minimal developer intervention.

### The Team Behind the Magic
Helium is led by a trio of growth-savvy co-founders:
- **Zach Witzel**: Formerly at Uber, he has engineered over $100 million in growth experiments.
- **Shishir Jakati**: An ex-Amazon employee who pioneered large language model features for Alexa.
- **Anish Doshi**: Known for improving Instagram ads conversion by 10% through machine learning at Meta.

Together, they bring a wealth of experience in AI and growth hacking, which they leverage to help businesses scale effectively.

### What Helium Does
Helium’s platform allows businesses to manage their paywalls without needing extensive coding knowledge. Here’s what sets them apart:

- **Visual Editing**: Users can edit their paywall UI and content through a visual editor, making the optimization process seamless.
- **Rapid Implementation**: New paywalls can be triggered anywhere in an app with a simple line of code—`Helium.showPaywall('onboarding');`. This reduces the friction that often comes with developer teams iterating on user experiences.
- **Experimentation Made Easy**: Businesses can easily set up A/B tests, even going beyond simple comparisons to sophisticated multivariate tests.

Keet started with a fundamental service—offering authentication for AI agents. Their platform enables developers to handle user authenticated sessions seamlessly across various software environments—be it legacy systems or popular consumer platforms. 

With Keet’s API or SDK, AI agents can access healthcare data, send messages on LinkedIn, or even interact with various consumer platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Essentially, Keet acts as a bridge, unlocking hard-to-access APIs and providing a unified interface for automation.

### Key Features

1. **No Chrome Extensions**: Keet doesn’t rely on cumbersome browser extensions, making the user experience smoother.
2. **Reverse Engineered Endpoints**: They leverage internal APIs to ensure reliable integrations without the fragility typically associated with automation tools.
3. **Quick Implementation**: The provided React components allow for rapid incorporation into existing projects.
4. **Stable Authentication**: Built-in infrastructure helps maintain authentication across necessary platforms without hassle.
5. **Data Privacy**: They prioritize user security by not storing end-user data or handling customer credentials.
6. **Custom Integrations**: If you need access to a platform Keet doesn’t currently support, they’re open to creating custom solutions.

### Use Cases

- **Legacy Software Integration**: Connect with older systems like CRMs and EHRs effortlessly.
- **Onboarding Automation**: Migrate user data from competitors to streamline the onboarding process for new customers.
- **Consumer Platform Automation**: Automate interactions on familiar platforms, enhancing user engagement without breaking a sweat.

### How It Works

To get started with Keet, developers can easily integrate their link component in their platform, allowing users to authenticate once. After that, actions and data extraction can happen smoothly in the background. This is beneficial for use cases where automation needs to happen behind the scenes, providing utility without user inconvenience.

### Conclusion

As AI and automation continue to gain traction, Keet positions itself as a critical player in simplifying and enhancing the authentication process for developers. Founded in 2024 and already part of Y Combinator, Keet's fresh approach to integrating with various platforms will likely resonate well as demand for seamless automation increases.

**Founded:** 2024  
**Location:** NAN  
**Team Size:** 2 employees  
**Y Combinator Batch:** S24

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, Kura AI is making waves with its mission to set a new standard for browser agents. Initially breaking through with an impressive 87% score on the WebVoyager Benchmark, Kura is 31% ahead of Claude's Computer Use demo and 14% better than the previous record-holder. Their focus is clear: they envision a future where, in just ten years, AI agents outnumber humans online.

### Why Kura Stands Out

Kura AI is pioneering tools that empower AI agents to navigate websites like never before. Their approach uses sophisticated models that boast:

- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Different AI roles such as Planner, Executor, and Critic collaborate in a seamless conversation about their actions.
- **Self-Healing Features:** The capability for reflection and backtracking ensures exceptional reliability.
- **Model Agnostic:** Users can leverage various models, including Gemini and GPT mini, to cut costs by nearly 90% with minimal accuracy trade-offs.
- **Multi-Modal Integration:** Combining computer vision with HTML DOM leads to greater accuracy.

### Performance at a Glance

Kura’s breakout performance on the WebVoyager Benchmark (87%) marks it as a leader in the space. Comparatively, other agents like Claude and Agent E score considerably lower. 

Despite its small team, Kura AI is set to revolutionize how we think about the interaction between humans and websites, significantly enhancing user experiences while reducing operational costs.

### The Takeaway

In a nutshell, Kura AI is not just about improving performance metrics; it’s about reimagining the landscape of browser agents. With its innovative technologies and solid backing from Y Combinator, Kura is laying the groundwork for a future where AI agents are smarter, cheaper, and more efficient.

### Mission
mdhub is on a mission to revolutionize mental health clinics by deploying AI assistants that streamline operations. The reality is that mental health clinicians often spend about half their time on administrative tasks instead of focusing on patient care. mdhub aims to change that by enhancing the efficiency of these professionals, potentially increasing their productivity by ten times.

### The Problem
Mental health professionals are painfully aware of the administrative burden they face. As they juggle patient appointments, insurance verifications, and documentation, the access to mental health care becomes delayed—leading to a critical need for solutions that can automate these processes.

### What They Do
mdhub focuses on automating the many tasks involved in mental healthcare provision. Their two primary offerings include:

1. **AI Clinical Assistant**: 
   - **Automated Clinical Notes**: Generate real-time notes based on session transcripts.
   - **Dictation and Live Session Recording**: Transcribe and create notes during live sessions.
   - **Pre-Charting**: Use AI to reduce cognitive load with suggestions and pre-filled information.
   - **Treatment Plans**: Rapidly create treatment plans using patient histories and clinical guidelines.

2. **AI Intake Coordinator**: 
   - **Seamless Phone Interactions**: Collects patient information through conversational interactions.
   - **Insurance Verification**: Automatically checks insurance eligibility.
   - **Follow-Up Tasks**: Ensures timely reminders and follow-ups for patients.
   - **Reports Generation**: Documents and organizes information from patient interactions.

### Target Audience
The primary users of mdhub's technology are mental health clinicians who want to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks. The company aims to enhance patient experiences while simultaneously improving clinicians' workflows.

### Technology and Approach
With an intuitive interface and seamless integration with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, mdhub’s AI tools are designed to handle complex data processing while ensuring compliance with data privacy standards, including HIPAA.

### Initial Traction
While it’s just the beginning for mdhub, their vision resonates with many in the mental healthcare field. With the promise of saving at least two hours a day on administrative tasks, they’ve garnered interest from clinics eager to leverage technology to enhance efficiency and patient care.

### Conclusion
mdhub is planting its flag in the burgeoning field of digital health, particularly within mental health. By focusing on automation through AI, they’re not just addressing a critical problem but actively reshaping how mental health services can be delivered more efficiently.

Mica AI is on a mission to transform B2B sales through the power of artificial intelligence. Founded in 2023 by a trio of innovators who met while studying at UC Berkeley, Mica builds AI agents that automate the often-time-consuming tasks associated with sales—specifically, analyzing sales calls, generating customized collateral, and following up with prospects until deals are closed.

#### The Problem

In the landscape of sales, the best representatives aren’t just convincing; they’re also exceptional content creators. They tailor presentations and supporting materials to resonate with individual buyers, but as they juggle multiple clients, this level of personalization becomes unsustainable. What takes elite salespeople over 30 minutes per call can make or break a deal. For the vast majority of sales teams, this results in lost opportunities and revenue—the numbers here are significant, with the sales collateral creation market alone clocking in at $11 billion in the U.S.

#### The Solution 

Enter Mica AI. By slashing the time spent on personalized follow-ups to under a minute, Mica empowers sales teams to perform at their best, ensuring that every client interaction is impactful. The AI agents not only enhance efficiency but democratize sales success—now, even average performers can leverage tools that enable them to sell like the top sellers.

The platform allows users to upload their sales call recordings, after which Mica analyzes the conversation to identify key topics of interest such as product features, pricing, and benefits. It then generates a personalized Deal Summary page that can be shared seamlessly with prospects. This ensures that critical information doesn’t get lost in translation—a common issue dubbed the ""game of telephone"" in sales discussions.

#### The Impact

The results speak for themselves: teams using Mica have reported a 25% reduction in sales cycle duration, a 30% increase in monthly deal closures, and a 60% faster follow-up rate with prospects. By creating champions within client organizations who can advocate for the solution, Mica accelerates the entire buying process.

#### The Future

Located in San Francisco and backed by Y Combinator's Batch S24, Mica is just at the beginning of its journey. With a team of three and ambitions to expand beyond initial offerings, they envision rolling out a fleet of agents that will eventually automate all aspects of the $80 billion enterprise sales market.

In a world where time is money, Mica AI is poised to change the game for sales teams everywhere.

The mission here is straightforward: Midship aims to extract, search, and analyze data within documents, mainly targeting the often cumbersome process of handling financial audits. Think about it. Traditionally, extracting relevant data from piles of PDFs and Excel documents would eat up hours of an auditor's time. Midship is flipping that script. In just five minutes, they can pull critical data, allowing auditors to focus on the insights rather than the grunt work. 

Their technology acts as an AI-augmented assistant, turning the laborious audit process into something far more efficient—a sort of GPS for auditors navigating through data. It organizes and structures documents, runs key audit tests, and automatically generates ready-to-submit Excel work papers, all while ensuring every AI decision is traceable back to relevant evidence. Plus, human oversight remains a core part of their process, ensuring that nothing gets rubber-stamped without thorough review.

With a lean team of three and a dedicated Group Partner in Diana Hu, Midship is positioned to make a significant impact on how audit firms work, promising to cut traditional audit times by 50% by 2026.

Founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's S24 batch, NetworkOcean is pioneering a novel approach to data centers by building and operating them underwater. The goal? To reduce power consumption by up to 30% and enhance the sustainability of GPU operations.

Why underwater? The concept targets significant efficiencies, including eliminating freshwater waste—about 10 billion gallons per year that conventional data centers squander cooling their systems. Plus, by situating the data centers in the ocean, the company can lower operational costs by 25% while also achieving edge-compute-level latency—up to a staggering 98% reduction in latency for users near coastal areas.

Currently a nimble team of just two, NetworkOcean operates out of San Francisco and is strategically guided by Group Partner Dalton Caldwell. Tagged as a hard-tech startup, the company unites interests in hardware, cloud computing, climate technology, and artificial intelligence. 

Their initial 1 MW capsule is undergoing testing in the San Francisco Bay, representing a critical step in validating their vision of sustainable computing.

Opslane is a promising startup that emerged from the Y Combinator Batch S24 in 2024, aimed squarely at alleviating the burdens of on-call engineers through the power of AI. Based in San Francisco, they are a small but dynamic team of two and are under the guidance of notable Group Partner Michael Seibel.

### Mission:
Opslane's core mission is clear: to expedite incident response for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) by automating crucial but often tedious tasks. The goal is simple yet profound—make on-call duty less of a headache for engineers, which ultimately translates to better service reliability across the board.

### How They Work:
Opslane's AI co-pilot model stitches together diverse sources of data—logs, metrics, traces, code changes, and runbooks—to illuminate issues faster than traditional debugging methods. This holistic view aids on-call engineers in quickly understanding what’s gone wrong, thereby speeding up incident resolution.

### Key Features:
- **Faster Incident Investigation**: By gathering and synthesizing relevant contextual information, Opslane ensures that SREs can diagnose and solve problems more efficiently.
  
- **Reduced Alert Fatigue**: With the overwhelming number of alerts often experienced in SRE work, Opslane helps filter out the noise, surfacing only the critical alerts that demand attention. This reduces false positives and ensures nothing important falls through the cracks.
  
- **User-Friendly Insights**: Not everyone can be a PromQL expert or navigate complex monitoring dashboards. Opslane offers a conversational interface via Slack that assists users in interpreting data without needing deep technical expertise, easing the learning curve significantly.

### Integration:
Designed to fit seamlessly into existing workflows, Opslane ensures minimal disruption and maximum utility.

### Final Thoughts:
With its innovative approach to tackling problems that plague the world of DevOps, Opslane is positioned to become an essential tool for engineering teams looking to optimize their incident response processes.

Founded in 2024 and currently part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Outerport is a cutting-edge startup located in San Francisco with a mission to revolutionize how AI comprehends documents. Their innovative technology employs a unique ""chain-of-memory reasoning"" approach that empowers AI to read and interpret complex documents like a human researcher would—section by section—while checking facts along the way.

Imagine needing to sift through a hefty 200-page compliance document. Traditional AI models often struggle with vague queries or complex structures, typically relying on vector similarity that doesn't quite grasp the intricacies of context. This is where Outerport shines. Their system not only identifies the relevant sections but also provides fact-based summaries and reasoning behind every retrieval, eliminating the fear of unreliable outputs often associated with AI’s tendency to “hallucinate” facts.

At its core, Outerport is built for performance. With capabilities that allow running thousands of queries on your documents without compromising quality, this tool is robust enough to handle unlimited document lengths—from a simple email to a dense policy manual—while maintaining clarity and context. The key to their process is smart reading, where their AI breaks down text into natural sections and builds a verified memory chain. This means it remembers critical details as it parses content, just as a human would, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the material.

Backed by a team of AI scientists from major tech companies like NVIDIA and Meta, Outerport aims to outpace traditional document processing systems by being 10x to 20x more efficient. Their intelligent processing redefines resource management, ensuring users get profound insights without the usual pitfalls of long context deterioration seen in many large language models.

Whether it's for compliance, research, or general document inquiry, Outerport gives organizations the robust tools they need to make sense of their extensive documentation intelligently. For financial services firms and research institutions looking to streamline their document comprehension process, Outerport is a game changer.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"Oway is a rideshare freight platform that uses machine learning to automatically coordinate and sell unused space in trucks to SMBs at a 50% discount for lightning-fast shipping. 

Every year, nearly 50% all truck space goes unused annually in the almost $1T US trucking industry. On the other hand, SMBs represent 44% of the US GDP and are historically forced to deal with high freight rates and friction due to their small size compared to enterprise businesses. 

With trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike.

Oway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before. We also improve the survivability of independent truckers by maximizing their revenue when they’re already on the road - and it’s great for the environment too. 🍃",2023.0,"[{'name': 'Phillip Nadjafov, Founder', 'description': 'Founder of Oway, an ML-based online rideshare platform that makes small-batch freight shipping affordable for everyone. \n\nSelf-taught engineer and occasional car designer.', 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillipnadjafov/'}]","### Overview of Oway

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"Consumers miss out on $70B+ every year because they're busy and unaware, and that money is sitting in their email inbox. So, we automated reading email receipts and claiming the money they're entitled to, offering a service to which you can sign up once, do (literally) nothing, and earn $.

Where is this money coming from?

- Retailers: When the price of clothes or furniture you've already bought drops, you're entitled to a refund for the difference
- Airlines: When a flight you've booked gets delayed or canceled, you're entitled to a cash compensation.
- Enterprises: When a class-action lawsuit is filed against a company you engage with, you're entitled to money.
- And many more, that even the government holds some of your unclaimed funds.

Today, the dream of one service that automatically claims the money you deserve when you shop, fly,... and live is (finally) possible.

We started with automating refunds in the shopping industry and have secured $8,000 in refunds to our users, growing 233% MoM. With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape.

#### Unique Value Proposition

- **Secure and Private:** Access is limited to email receipts, ensuring user data safety.
- **Guaranteed Rewards:** If no refund is secured within 30 days, users receive a gift card as compensation.

#### Customer Testimonials
Users rave about the service, expressing disbelief in how simple it is to get money refunded back to their accounts. Statements like, “If you’re not on pap! You’re just losing money, period,” and “I just buy right away and watch the money come back to my account!” underline pap!'s significant impact.

Government AI procurement mirrors outdated IT practices—pay millions, wait years.

Paradome is on a mission to transform how government agencies develop and deploy artificial intelligence. Founded in 2024, this dynamic startup aims to expedite AI integration, making it rapid, cost-effective, and compliant with regulatory standards. Operating out of New York and part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Paradome is a small team of three driven by a shared vision.

**The Problem With Traditional Government AI Procurement**

Government procurement for AI has long been bogged down by outdated IT practices. The typical process is painfully slow and expensive—agencies often spend millions and wait for years, only to end up with complex systems that are hard to maintain. This inefficiency arises from several factors:
1. Building data integrations and compliance systems from scratch.
2. A lack of deep AI expertise among conventional contractors.
3. Minimal user feedback during development.
4. Continuous costs related to monitoring and maintaining custom solutions.

**Paradome's Solution: Near-Zero Deployment Cost and Time**

Paradome's innovative platform dramatically reduces the time and financial investment required for compliant AI deployment. By creating a modular environment—dubbed NOVA—Paradome addresses these pain points head-on. NOVA combines low-code tools with full-code extensibility, streamlining the entire process of data integration, optimization, compliance, and real-time monitoring. This means agencies can focus on improving services through iteration rather than getting stuck in the development phase.

**The Power of Adaptive Agents**

Here's how it works: Paradome allows agencies to easily build and deploy AI agents that can integrate seamlessly with existing tools. These agents collect user feedback, ensuring fast and measurable improvements in performance. The platform is already FedRamp compliant, facilitating ongoing monitoring and compliance with necessary regulations.

**Key Features of Paradome’s Offerings:**

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Offers a suite of tools for data processing and AI development, leveraging pre-built pipelines and compliance models.
- **Data Integration:** Connects existing data stores, enabling agencies to streamline their data accessibility.
- **Compliance Made Simple:** Provides features for meeting AI governance requirements, including explainability and interpretability.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Offers insights into model accuracy and system health from an intuitive dashboard.

**Conclusion**

As agencies strive to deliver consistent and efficient public services, Paradome is making that not only possible but also practical. By rethinking the AI integration process, Paradome is enhancing the governmental landscape, emphasizing that making government work isn’t just an option—it’s a civic duty.

- **Intelligent Workflow Execution:** It can utilize existing runbooks, executing them automatically in response to alerts.
- **Seamless Communication:** Parity allows users to interact directly with their infrastructure, asking questions and receiving insights as if they were conversing with a colleague.

**Team and Leadership**

The company is currently small, with a team of just three employees. Jared Friedman serves as the Group Partner, providing crucial support and guidance as they navigate the early stages of growth.

**Target Market and Tags**

Parity is primarily targeting developers and businesses in the B2B space, particularly those operating within the Kubernetes ecosystem and looking to enhance their DevOps capabilities. Its focus on artificial intelligence and developer tools positions it well in the growing demand for efficient infrastructure management solutions.

Their core mission is bold: to automate hospital reporting processes and safeguard patients using artificial intelligence. Given the current landscape, where clinicians often waste valuable hours sifting through complex medical records for mandatory reporting, Pharos' solution could not be more timely.

Here's the crux of the problem: healthcare professionals currently bear the burden of painstakingly pulling facts from unstructured medical records. This not only drains resources but also puts patients at risk due to human error. Enter Pharos, which leverages AI to streamline this reporting process. Their technology instantly extracts critical data, allowing healthcare teams to focus on what matters most—patient care.

**What’s In It for Hospitals?**

Pharos offers more than just automation; it enhances patient safety. By identifying areas where patient harm could occur, their AI-powered analytics deliver insights that help prevent adverse events. The Pharos platform enables quick comprehension of quality and risk metrics, turning what used to be weeks of manual effort into mere hours of data processing.

Currently, they are targeting:

- **Chart Abstraction**: Automating the review process for clinical submissions.
- **Root Cause Analyses (RCAs)**: Helping clinicians respond to safety events more swiftly.
- **Compliance Audits**: Providing rapid insights into hospital performance against key metrics.

**Security at its Core**

With a keen eye on data security, Pharos runs a HIPAA-compliant platform adaptable to any data management system, whether cloud-based or local. They understand the importance of privacy in healthcare and are committed to integrating seamlessly with existing Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

Backing this promising startup are notable names in the venture space, including Moxxie, Felicis, and General Catalyst, with Jared Friedman serving as their Group Partner. Pharos recently raised $5 million in seed funding to fuel its mission to reshape the healthcare narrative through technology.

**Overview**

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch S24, Promi is a budding company based in an undisclosed location, with a lean team of two. Their mission is clear: **optimizing eCommerce pricing through dynamic, personalized discounts.** 

**The Problem**

Ecommerce merchants often rely on guesswork when it comes to discounting strategies—whether it's for customer acquisition, holiday sales, or clearing inventory. This approach usually involves a subjective analysis of past sales data or simply what feels right. Naturally, this can lead to missed opportunities.

**The Solution**

Enter Promi. This AI-powered platform takes the guesswork out of discount allocation by leveraging data from the store. It dynamically determines the best discount values for each product based on user behavior, timing, and historical data. The platform aims to maximize both sales and profit by delivering tailored discounts to the right customers at the right moments.

**Key Features**

- **Personalized Product Discounts:** Create tailored clearance sales, volume discounts, and subscription offers.
- **Email & SMS Optimization:** Enhance campaigns by integrating personalized pricing that triggers via Klaviyo.
- **Onsite Popups:** Set up personalized interactions like welcome offers and sign-up discounts.

Promi's approach has notable results. In a recent case, a user reported a **92% increase in flow revenue** and significant improvements in open and click rates. This isn't just about offering more discounts; it's about using data intelligently to drive profitability, with reports showing an average revenue increase of **24%** and profit increase of **15%** across its users.

**How It Works**

1. **Data Collection:** Promi collects a variety of customer data—device types, sources of traffic, transaction history, and more.
2. **AI Training:** This data trains Promi's AI model to predict conversion rates and price elasticity for each customer.
3. **Dynamic Discounts:** It then issues personalized discounts based on the predicted behavior, which can apply in real-time or through email and SMS campaigns.

**Installation and Support**

Promi provides a **white-glove installation service**, ensuring that setup is swift, typically taking less than 48 hours. They focus on user-friendliness, enabling businesses of all sizes to enhance their discount strategies efficiently.

**Conclusion**

If you're in the eCommerce space and looking to refine your pricing strategy, Promi might just be the game-changing solution you need. With a focus on AI-optimized, personalized discounting, they're not just making discounts smarter; they're making businesses more lucrative.

1. **Connect with the Design Team:** Customers start by booking a quick 10-minute call with Rastro's design experts. This is where they discuss their vision and preferences while sharing images of their space.
   
2. **Product Sourcing:** Rastro’s AI agents then comb through over 40 different retailer sites to find unique home decor items that match the customer's style and budget.

3. **Product Selection:** Once the AI has curated a list of matching products, they’re sent directly to the customer's inbox for review. Customers can choose what appeals to them from this curated selection.

4. **Delivery:** Products are shipped directly to the customer's door without additional costs. Rastro earns money through referrals and partnerships, making it a free service for users.

**Market Potential**

Given that hiring an interior designer can cost thousands, Rastro presents a much more affordable option for consumers wanting stylish home decor. Their AI-driven approach has shown to convert at rates ten times higher than traditional e-commerce searches, making for a compelling case for both individual users and potential investors.

Currently part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Rastro is tagged under consumer tech, retail-tech, and AI, indicating its growth potential in the expansive market of home goods.

The company is backed by significant expertise in AI and e-commerce, with figures like Tom Blomfield as a Group Partner. With its blend of innovative technology and user-centric design, Rastro is positioned to not just provide products, but to curate an experience.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"Our Mission: 
We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.

The Problem: 
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).

Our Approach: 
In our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",2024.0,"[{'name': 'Alexander Pomberger, Founder', 'description': 'Alexander holds a PhD in chemical engineering, and has been working at the intersection of machine learning, chemistry and lab automation for the past 5 years.

**Overview:**  
Remo is a startup on a mission to redefine compliance in the banking sector through the power of artificial intelligence. Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Remo targets the financial institutions struggling with manual processes in onboarding and compliance—specifically Know Your Business (KYB), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and ongoing monitoring.

**The Problem:**

- **Customizable Compliance:** Tailored workflows cater to the unique needs of each institution, ensuring regulatory requirements are met without sacrificing efficiency.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous oversight and risk detection help maintain compliance long after the initial onboarding is completed.
- **Enterprise Security:** Built to SOC2 standards, ensuring that data integrity and confidentiality are paramount, thus paving the way for audit-ready processes.

**Current Status:**

Despite being a nascent company, their vision is to make compliance seamless and efficient, ensuring that financial institutions can grow without the burden of slow processes.

**Why It Matters:**

Rewbi is an innovative company aimed at revolutionizing the energy sector by leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize grid-connected battery storage. Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, Rewbi's mission is to double the revenue generated from these battery systems. 

### What They Do
Initially focusing on optimizing battery storage, Rewbi enhances profitability by charging batteries when electricity rates are low and discharging them when prices peak—transforming a straightforward rental model into a revenue-generating powerhouse. Their business model is simple: they charge a fixed monthly fee for battery storage but increase that revenue twofold through smart dispatching.

### The Problem They Solve
Traditionally, power companies rely on human traders to manage battery dispatch schedules, which is slow and inefficient. Rewbi's AI technology changes the game. Batteries can adjust their output significantly faster—up to 100 times quicker than traditional power sources like coal or gas. Given that electricity prices can fluctuate dramatically—sometimes by 300% within five minutes—Rewbi’s AI can analyze hundreds of data points in real-time to make instant decisions that optimize battery dispatch.

### Team and Expertise
The company sports a lean team of two co-founders with notable backgrounds: 
- **Thomas Marge**, the CEO, previously founded inBalance, a Y Combinator company acquired by Stem, where he led battery storage optimization.
- **Derek Modzelewski**, the CTO, has deep experience in energy commodities and AI, having previously worked with Meta's foundational models.

This strong expertise merges energy and AI proficiencies, which is crucial for driving the clean energy transition.

### Clean Energy Future
Rewbi is not just about profits; it focuses on sustainability. Modern grids often rely on backup fossil fuel sources, contributing to over 1% of global carbon emissions during peak demands. Rewbi aims to replace these systems with clean battery alternatives, pushing toward a greener energy future.

### Conclusion
Rewbi is at the forefront of a significant shift in the energy sector, combining advanced AI with battery storage solutions to create efficiency that the industry desperately needs. The company is set to improve grid reliability, drive down costs associated with power volatility, and help in the fight against climate change, all while ensuring a profitable outcome for battery investors.

Founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S24, SchemeFlow is on a mission to streamline the often convoluted process of gaining government approvals for construction projects. At its core, SchemeFlow harnesses the power of AI to drastically cut down the time it takes to generate the necessary technical reports—reducing what once required months to mere minutes.

The company was born from the partnership of two brothers and a high school friend, each bringing a unique skill set: a Mayor’s Chief of Staff skilled in navigating bureaucracy, a construction engineer from Arup, and an AI software engineer. This trifecta combines industry knowledge with technical prowess, forming the ideal team to tackle the complexities of construction regulations.

Using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), SchemeFlow has already accomplished the impressive feat of generating over 10,000 pages of report documentation for more than 400 projects—including car parks, hotels, and office buildings. The resulting time savings are staggering: up to 97%. This efficiency is attractive not just for construction firms, but for the consultants who aid them.

Initially launched in the UK, SchemeFlow quickly pivoted to target the U.S. market, where there’s a staggering $9 billion opportunity. There are approximately 143,000 consultants currently involved in report writing, which SchemeFlow can significantly benefit, or there’s an even larger $23 billion potential on a global scale.

Located in San Francisco with a compact team of four, SchemeFlow is making waves in the domains of generative AI, government technology (govtech), and proptech. They’re currently engaged in automating the drafting of crucial technical reports for various sectors such as transportation, environment, and economic development.

With a clear focus and ambitious plans, SchemeFlow stands ready to transform the landscape of construction project approvals.

Founded in 2024, Seals AI is on a mission to bring automation to wholesalers and distributors through a suite of AI employees. The core idea is to replace time-consuming manual tasks—like quoting, order taking, and data entry—with smart software that can manage all these operations efficiently. With around 700,000 wholesalers in the U.S. still relying heavily on outdated practices, this presents a monumental opportunity for cost savings and productivity boosts.

The team behind Seals AI consists of three Computer Science graduates with notable experience in the tech industry. Fernando, one of the co-founders, played a critical role in launching AT&T's operations in Mexico, driving it to a whopping $120 million ARR. They previously collaborated at a Y Combinator-backed startup, where they successfully navigated the intricacies of B2B sales and processed thousands of purchase orders.

Seals AI aims to revolutionize the B2B supply chain landscape, where communication often happens via phone or email and numerous tasks remain manual. By integrating AI agents capable of interacting through various means—phone, email, SMS, and even WhatsApp—the company is positioned to help businesses turn approximately $100 billion of payroll expenses into software spending. This could redefine how wholesalers operate, making them more agile and profitable.

Located in San Francisco and currently part of the YCombinator S24 batch, Seals AI is a lean team of four, backed by industry experts. Their AI offerings include specialized roles like AI Sales, which handles orders and quotes; AI Retention, focused on customer engagement; and AI Support, ensuring customer issues are resolved swiftly. This holistic approach promises to drive sales and enhance customer relationships, all while providing real-time monitoring and management of business workflows.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"With AI increasingly automating away code generation, software engineers will spend more time reading, judging, and architecting code rather than writing it. Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.

We are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:
1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?
2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?
3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?

Sage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.

No group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. 

We have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.",2023.0,"[{'name': 'Julia Turc, Founder', 'description': 'Cofounder @ Storia & previously at Google Research.\n\n10+ years in NLP.

Excited about how NLP is now redefining software engineering.', 'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/iulia-raluca-turc/'}]","**Storia AI: Revolutionizing Code Understanding with an Open-Source AI Copilot**

In the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, Storia AI is carving out a unique niche. Founded in 2023 and currently part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Storia AI is on a mission to transform how developers interact with code. Their vision is straightforward yet ambitious: to build an open-source AI copilot that comprehensively understands a company's code and its broader context. 

As the industry moves towards automating code generation, software engineers increasingly find themselves in roles that require deep comprehension of existing code rather than just writing new lines. Storia AI tackles this shift head-on with a tool named Sage. Think of Sage as a smart assistant for developers—an AI that not only generates suggestions but truly understands the nuances of a specific codebase.

### What Can Sage Do?

Sage acts as a powerful resource for developers, capable of answering complex questions that go beyond simple coding tasks. Here’s what it offers:

1. **Contextual Recommendations**: Developers can consult Sage on technical choices, like determining the right vector database that meets project constraints.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: It can clarify why one database option might be more suitable than another—say, Redis versus Milvus.
3. **Integration Queries**: Sage assesses codebases for compatibility with other libraries and provides actionable steps for integration.

What sets Sage apart is its reliance on verified sources. Instead of generating potentially misleading information (a common issue known as ""hallucination""), Sage provides answers anchored in a wealth of documentation from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and internal technical documents. This places reliable, contextualized knowledge directly in the hands of developers.

### A Strong Foundation

Storia AI was founded by a small but formidable team with deep roots in both AI and software engineering. Julia has extensive experience with contextual neural networks, having worked on foundational technologies at Google, while Mihail was instrumental in developing early LLMs (Large Language Models) at Amazon Alexa. Their 20+ years of combined experience positions them uniquely to tackle the challenges of building an AI that comprehends complex codebases.

### Where They’re Headed

Currently located in Millbrae, CA, Storia AI operates with a compact team of two talented individuals, backed by David Lieb as their Group Partner. The tagging of their work in areas like ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘developer tools’, and ‘machine learning’ indicates a focused strategy that resonates deeply within the tech community. As they progress, there are ambitious goals to deepen Sage’s understanding of not just private codebases but potentially every line of code available online.

In a nutshell, Storia AI is not just another tech startup; it's a thoughtful response to the inevitable evolution of software development. By building a bridge between AI and developers, they’re paving the way for more efficient, informed, and high-quality code architecture.

**Overview**  
Terra is a startup established in 2024, operating out of New York and participating in Y Combinator's Batch S24. The company, with a small team of six, aims to transform the way businesses procure custom goods, positioning itself as the ""Faire for custom goods.""

**Mission & Vision**  
Terra’s mission is to streamline the journey from design to production. By connecting suppliers, simplifying sampling, and allowing businesses to track production in real-time, they effectively eliminate the uncertainties typically associated with overseas manufacturing.

**How It Works**  
Terra leverages technology to act as a buying group. Here’s the gist: they receive individual orders from clients, bundle similar ones together, and negotiate bulk pricing without minimum order quantities (MOQs). This means businesses can order exactly what they need, when they need it, without being stuck with excess inventory. This model gives clients access to over 10,000 products at factory prices—far cheaper than typical retail rates.

**Key Features**  
- **Wholesale Pricing**: By bypassing traditional retail channels, Terra allows businesses to access products at significantly lower prices.
- **No MOQs**: Say goodbye to the stress of minimum order requirements; clients can order only what they need.
- **Quick Turnarounds**: Their system accommodates both standard and expedited shipping options, ensuring that businesses aren't left waiting around.

**Market Position**  
Terra competes against high-retail markups and the traditional supply chain inefficiencies. Their platform consolidates communications, avoids the hassle of dealing with multiple suppliers, and offers dedicated concierge support to provide a seamless experience.

**Unique Selling Proposition**  
Imagine not having to worry about inventory management while also accessing quality products equivalent to those offered by big-name retailers, but without the hefty price tags. Terra's software bridges the gap by finding similar orders and consolidating them to meet factory requirements, which keeps costs low.

**Fun Fact**  
Through Terra, you can buy quality furniture directly from manufacturers—often at prices that are a fraction of what you’d see in stores. For instance, a couch priced at $3,799 elsewhere might be available for just $1,664 through Terra.

**Conclusion**  
In a nutshell, Terra is reshaping the procurement landscape for custom goods, making it easier and more affordable for businesses to access quality products. If you're in the market for custom items without the traditional headaches of supplier management, Terra is the solution you've been waiting for.

Founded in 2024 and hailing from Atlanta, GA, Thunder Compute is on a mission to revolutionize GPU accessibility through virtualization. In an era where AI development is exploding, Thunder Compute's team of three aims to tackle the high costs associated with traditional GPU setups and inefficient usage in data centers.

**The Problem**  
Many developers are aware that a single GPU server can cost upwards of $300K, yet those GPUs are only utilized about 15-20% of the time. It’s a glaring waste of resources. Thunder Compute has identified this inefficiency and is stepping up to transform it.

**The Solution**  
Thunder Compute's technology enables data centers to pool GPU resources instead of tethering them to individual servers. This allows for a staggering potential boost in GPU utilization—from a mere 15-20% to over 90%. By sharing GPUs among multiple developers, each GPU becomes effectively five times cheaper for users, making powerful machine learning capabilities accessible to a wider audience. The company’s approach saves users up to 80% on GPU costs, which is something anyone dabbling in AI will appreciate.

**Pricing and Offering**  
With competitive pricing, Thunder Compute offers attractive hourly rates for leading GPUs—like the NVIDIA Tesla T4 at just $0.27/hr and the A100 (40GB) for $0.57/hr. Users can quickly set up and manage GPU instances through a straightforward command-line interface (CLI), which makes onboarding fast and intuitive.

**User Experience**  
Customer feedback underscores the satisfaction with Thunder’s ease of use. Users have reported significant cost savings, stating that transcribing extensive data only cost them around $6—an exemplary case of Thunder Compute delivering on its promise.

**Team and Support**  
With a compact yet focused team, backed by Y Combinator’s Batch S24, Thunder Compute is primed for scalability. Under the mentorship of Aaron Epstein, the company is deftly navigating early-stage growth and product development.

**Get Involved**  
Interested parties can try Thunder Compute at [docs.thundercompute.com](https://docs.thundercompute.com/quickstart) or explore their offerings on their main website [thundercompute.com](https://thundercompute.com).

Founded in 2024 and part of Y Combinator Batch S24, Tivara is a forward-looking startup on a mission to revolutionize the healthcare insurance approval process. Their innovative use of large language models (LLMs) aims to streamline prior authorizations for healthcare clinics, making them both faster and more cost-effective.

The company is based entirely online, minimizing overhead while maximizing reach, and they currently operate with a lean team of just two dedicated employees. At the helm are co-founders Tej Seelamsetty (CEO) and Aumesh Misra (CTO), both of whom are motivated by personal experiences with frustrating delays in healthcare services stemming from slow insurance approvals.

### What Tivara Does

Tivara is all about speed and efficiency in handling prior authorizations. Here’s how they’re shaking things up:

- **Rapid Approvals**: The platform claims to approve care-critical prior authorizations at a staggering 30 times the speed of traditional processes, all while reducing costs by up to 80%. This means clinics can serve patients faster, which is a win for everyone involved.
  
- **One-Click Submission**: With Tivara, authorization requests are generated directly from provider orders and patient charts, significantly cutting down the time needed for submissions. This feature not only expedites the process but also minimizes errors.

- **Transparency and Tracking**: Tivara's system allows clinics to monitor the status of every authorization request without the need for endless phone calls, delivering much-needed clarity to the often opaque insurance approval process.

- **Analytics Dashboard**: They provide clinics with analytics to track key performance indicators, giving insights into where workflow inefficiencies might be and how teams can improve over time.

- **EMR Integration**: The platform seamlessly connects with any electronic medical record (EMR) system, allowing healthcare providers to generate authorization requests directly from patient data.

### The Takeaway

Tivara is addressing a significant pain point in the healthcare sector—the slow, cumbersome process of insurance prior authorizations. By leveraging the power of AI and LLMs, they are not just building software but creating a healthcare ecosystem where care is prioritized over cumbersome insurance policies. This focus on empowering doctors to lead care rather than navigating bureaucratic hurdles reflects a deeper understanding of the healthcare landscape.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S24,,,"At Village Labs, we help America's businesses become employee owned by helping them set up and manage an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). 

ESOPs are a federal retirement plan that enable businesses to give their employees a stake in the company in exchange for significant tax benefits. 

With 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing ""Silver Tsunami"" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.

By selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of — things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire — imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. 

Thousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth.

Founded in 2023 and based in New York, Village Labs is on a mission to transform America’s businesses by making them employee-owned. The core of their approach lies in facilitating Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)—a powerful federal retirement plan that allows employees to acquire shares in their companies, often with significant tax advantages.

As Baby Boomers retire, there’s an impending ""Silver Tsunami"" of businesses looking for new ownership. Instead of selling to private equity or external buyers, Village Labs helps owners transition their businesses to ESOPs. This process ensures they receive a fair price for their business while also supporting their employees—who can build wealth over their careers through ownership. Imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire—this isn't just a dream but a tangible outcome for many employees in ESOP companies.

Currently, thousands of businesses, including well-known names like Bob's Red Mill and Harpoon Brewery, benefit from ESOPs, collectively generating over $2.1 trillion in employee wealth and benefiting more than 14 million workers. Village Labs is striving to increase these impressive statistics by simplifying the process for businesses looking to make this shift.

The company is part of Y Combinator Batch S24 and is spearheaded by a small but dedicated team of two, under the guidance of Group Partner Dalton Caldwell. They offer a suite of AI-driven products tailored for ESOPs, including:

- **VillageOS**: A centralized management system for plan documents and participant records, equipped with AI search and analytics.
- **Repurchase Forecasting**: Tools designed to help companies model and understand their repurchase obligations.
- **Third Party Administration**: Full-service administration for ESOPs, upcoming soon.
- For service providers, they provide a **Custom AI System** designed specifically for ESOP service providers like trustees and valuation firms.

Village Labs is not just about numbers, though. They believe that employee ownership is critical for fostering a stable and motivated workforce—data shows that ESOP companies often experience lower turnover rates and greater employee satisfaction.

Founded in 2024 and hailing from Y Combinator's Batch S24, ZeroPath is paving the way for software developers to tackle security vulnerabilities with unprecedented ease. Located in the tech hub of San Francisco, this dynamic start-up, with a lean team of just four, is making waves in the developer-tools and cybersecurity sectors.

#### Mission and Vision

ZeroPath's mission is clear: to automatically find and fix vulnerabilities in your software. It serves as an essential tool for developers, acting like an extra pair of eyes that spots potential security issues typically only identified during penetration tests or bug bounty programs.

#### How It Works

ZeroPath autonomously detects, verifies, and even submits fixes for vulnerabilities present in your code. The setup is straightforward—integrating the GitHub app takes under two minutes, after which your existing CI/CD pipeline can benefit from real-time security checks. By identifying and patching broken authentication, logic bugs, and outdated dependencies, ZeroPath aims to streamline the development process while bolstering security. 

Instead of producing overwhelming reports filled with false positives, it generates pull requests (PRs) when confident changes won’t disrupt your applications. This makes security a seamless part of the development process—a true win-win for engineers.

#### Features That Stand Out

- **AI-Powered Scanning:** With impressive efficacy, ZeroPath's scanning engine finds critical bugs while minimizing false positives.
- **Continuous Integration Support:** ZeroPath integrates easily with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket—no more long waits for security audits or extensive PR reviews.
