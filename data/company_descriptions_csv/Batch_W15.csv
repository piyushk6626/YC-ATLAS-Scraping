Founded in 2014 and part of Y Combinator’s W15 batch, Industrial Microbes is driven by a clear mission: developing engineered microbes to create greener chemicals at a lower cost. Nestled in Alameda, California, this ambitious team of twelve is on a mission to revolutionize how we produce essential materials.

Their focus is twofold. First, they aim to collaborate with global enterprises to transform waste into viable resources for producing chemicals, polymers, and even solutions for space exploration. Think of it as a biologically-inspired approach to sustainability, where the materials we need come from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels.

At the heart of their technology are programmable microbes that utilize low-carbon feedstocks like ethanol and methane. Through a process reminiscent of brewing whiskey—fermentation, heating, and distillation—they create net-zero materials that can seamlessly replace traditional petrochemical products. Their innovations are not just theoretical; they’ve successfully scaled their processes to produce low-carbon acrylic acid precursors, having already partnered with notable commercial allies.

What’s impressive is their commitment to not just innovation but also impact. By using biomethane in their processes, they’ve achieved cost reductions of 30% to 45%, while striving for net-zero emissions—a powerful double win in the climate fight.

With 9 years of development under their belt, 22 patents, and $10 million in funding, Industrial Microbes stands ready to make significant contributions to the fields of climate change mitigation and sustainable materials.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W15,,,"The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India’s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses.  Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.

Over the last couple of years, Razorpay’s growth has evolved to be an index of India’s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. 

Razorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway ‘Curlec by Razorpay’ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. 

Be it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.

Over the years, Razorpay’s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. 

Razorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 -  The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.

All these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn’t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",2014.0,[],"**Razorpay: Simplifying Financial Solutions for Indian Businesses**

Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar, Razorpay emerged from a vision to make online payments accessible and seamless for Indian businesses, especially for startups and SMEs that were previously underserved.

Additionally, it’s noteworthy that Razorpay is part of Y Combinator's Batch W15, a testament to its innovative ethos.

Shasqi has raised a more than $60M in funding, with its lead asset in Phase 2 and a growing pipeline of drugs.', 'linkedin': 'http://www.linkedin.com/in/joseperu/'}]","**Company Summary: Shasqi**

Shasqi is a cutting-edge biotech company on a mission to revolutionize cancer treatment using a novel approach known as click chemistry. Founded in 2015 and part of the Y Combinator Batch W15, Shasqi is headquartered in San Francisco and comprises a dedicated team of 28 professionals.

At the heart of Shasqi’s innovation is its proprietary CAPAC™ platform, which is designed to deliver targeted cancer therapeutics effectively. The technology utilizes a clever mechanism of localized click chemistry—where a reagent is specifically concentrated in the tumor area. This localized approach allows an activated protodrug, infused systemically, to “click” and create a powerful therapy right at the tumor site. This method not only enhances the effectiveness of cancer treatment but also significantly reduces systemic exposure, keeping it below toxic thresholds.

Though the company isn’t currently publicly sharing specific projects, it continues to solidify its reputation in the biotech field, tagged with key areas of expertise including therapeutics and innovation in cancer treatment.

In the competitive landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area biotech scene, Shasqi stands out for its distinct approach and commitment to battling cancer.

SIRUM has become a leader in prescription drug donations, providing consulting and technical assistance to county governments, community clinics and multiple drug donor groups to establish redistribution programs",,[],"### Company Overview: SIRUM

**Mission**
SIRUM is essentially a ""match.com"" for unused medicine. Its mission is to connect surplus medications with those who need them most, particularly underserved populations who struggle with healthcare access. By simplifying and streamlining the donation process, SIRUM helps safety-net clinics to obtain vital medications for their patients.

**Background**
Founded in 2015 and incubated at Stanford University, SIRUM has leveraged its academic roots to become a key player in the nonprofit sector focused on healthcare. With the guidance of Stanford faculty and alumni, SIRUM has grown into a leader in prescription drug donations and has provided critical consulting and technical assistance to various stakeholders including county governments, community clinics, and drug donor organizations.

**Location and Team**
Based in Palo Alto, California, SIRUM currently employs a team of 15 dedicated individuals.

**Core Activities**
SIRUM operates as a national redistributor of surplus medicine, handling what is estimated to be around $11 billion worth of unexpired, unopened medications that go to waste each year. The organization facilitates the donation process by:

1. **Collecting Surplus Medicine**: Individuals and organizations can donate excess medications instead of discarding them.
2. **Matching Donated Medicine**: SIRUM utilizes technology to connect this surplus with community partners that need it.
3. **Distributing to Patients**: Community partners provide the medications to patients who lack access otherwise.

By coordinating the donation and redistribution of medicines, SIRUM plays a vital role in enhancing healthcare access.

**Current Initiatives**
Recently, SIRUM has partnered with Good Pill to expand its impact into Illinois, showcasing its commitment to reaching more communities. They actively encourage all stakeholders, including individuals, manufacturers, and pharmacies, to get involved through their donation and medicine distribution efforts.

**Impact**
SIRUM proudly showcases its impressive metrics, which highlight the sheer volume of medicine redistributed and the number of individuals positively affected. The commitment to capturing real-time impacts is a cornerstone of their transparency and accountability.

**Why It Matters**
In a landscape where 50 million Americans forgo necessary medications due to prohibitive costs, SIRUM addresses a critical healthcare crisis. Their approach not only saves medicine but also lives, allowing individuals to prioritize their health without the financial burden that often accompanies it.

**Get Involved**

Founded in July 2014, The Human Utility started its journey as the Detroit Water Project. Its mission is straightforward yet profound: to eliminate water service disconnections for families across the United States. It tackles a critical issue—over 40 million families face the harsh reality that essential utilities are often unaffordable. This leads families to make heart-wrenching choices between paying for water, food, or even medication.

What is innovative about The Human Utility is its crowdfunding platform that connects donors directly to families in need, effectively acting like a loan syndicate for water bills. Donors can choose to contribute directly to a specific family or contribute to a universal assistance fund, enhancing the chances for families to regain and maintain access to water.

The Human Utility employs a data-driven approach to identify the root causes of water affordability issues. By analyzing utility data, the organization designs interventions aimed at ensuring families never face disconnections again.

**Key Operations:**

- The organization operates primarily in Oakland, CA, with a small team of just 2 employees.
- As part of Y Combinator's Batch W15, The Human Utility has garnered support from more than 4,500 donors since its inception, enabling it to assist over 2,000 families so far.
- They actively promote awareness around the idea that affordable water is a human right, particularly highlighting the struggles of families in cities like Detroit and Baltimore.

**Community Engagement:**

The Human Utility encourages public participation through donations, highlighting that even small contributions can have a significant impact. Their platform allows individuals from anywhere to become agents of change, standing up for a cause that many believe is fundamental—access to clean water.

If you’re interested in supporting their mission, you can donate through their website, provide services if you're in a related profession, or partner with them if you’re part of a community organization in need of assistance.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,W15,,,"Forty million men in the US and over 500 million worldwide suffer from urinary obstruction related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The majority of men will experience symptoms of this disease at some point in life. BPH, also known as prostate enlargement, leads to urinary straining, frequency, urgency, and sleep disruption. Despite the high prevalence and significant quality of life burden of BPH, established treatments are limited to drugs, which have limited effectiveness, and surgery, which carries a high risk of sexual side effects.

Zenflow is on a mission to transform the treatment landscape for urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). With around forty million men in the U.S. and over 500 million worldwide affected by this condition, the need for effective solutions is glaring. BPH, or prostate enlargement, leads to a cascade of frustrating symptoms—think frequent trips to the bathroom, urgency, and even disrupted sleep. The common treatments now? Medications that often fall short and surgeries that come with daunting risks of sexual side effects.

Enter the Zenflow Spring—a small, innovative implant that offers a breakthrough. Delivered in a urologist's office through a straightforward procedure, this device provides quick and long-lasting symptom relief. For many men, this could mean a significant improvement in their quality of life, all without the invasive implications of traditional surgical approaches.

Founded in 2014 and nurtured through Y Combinator's W15 batch, Zenflow is based in South San Francisco, California, and operates with a team of 18 talented individuals. They’re focused and efficient, and their ambition is backed by strong partnership ties.
