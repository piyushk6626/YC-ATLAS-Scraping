Founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator’s Batch S23, Aglide is a fresh player in the identity management space based out of San Francisco. With a compact team of just two, Aglide is tackling one of the IT industry's more cumbersome challenges: integrating disparate applications into a single sign-on (SSO) system without the convoluted protocols you often hear about, like SAML or SCIM.

### What They Do

Aglide's mission is clear: **""Natively connect any app to your SSO.""** They leverage something they call “agentic technology” to streamline access management across apps, which means users can log in to any application using their existing SSO credentials. For administrators, this tool provides robust features like conditional access policies, session revocation, and the ability to migrate unmanaged accounts into a secure SSO framework within seconds.

**Key Offerings:**
- **Single Sign-On**: Offers a security model similar to SAML, but without its typical complexities.
- **Access Control**: Admins can set access rules based on device management or geolocation.
- **Password Management**: Aglide comes equipped with an encrypted vault for sensitive information like credit cards and API keys.
- **Ghost App Detection**: It identifies unmanaged applications, allowing companies to maintain control over their digital landscape.

### The Problem with SSO

One of the big issues companies face is what's often referred to as the ""SSO tax."" This term captures the high costs often associated with integrating SSO systems with existing applications. Aglide sets itself apart by focusing on a cost-efficient model that aims to save businesses money even from the first application switched over to their service.

### Federal to Scale

Despite being in its infancy, Aglide has big ambitions and the backing of Y Combinator, which suggests a bright future ahead. With their unique technology, they promise to make SSO accessible to every app, encouraging businesses to break free from the constraints of traditional protocols and extend their SSO capabilities.

### Conclusion

Aglide is addressing a real pain point in the identity management landscape with a bold new approach to SSO integration. Given their innovative technology and the backing of a notable accelerator, they could indeed be the next big thing, simplifying access management while ensuring security across the board.

Founded in 2023 as part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, Artie is a San Francisco-based startup that's redefining how data is handled. Its mission? To stream data from databases to data warehouses in real-time, ensuring that businesses always have access to live production data rather than outdated snapshots that come from traditional ETL processes, which typically run every few hours or overnight.

### The Problem with Traditional ETL

Many organizations still rely on these legacy ETL processes, but Artie aims to change that. By using Artie, companies can eliminate the lag between data collection and accessibility, allowing for a much more agile response to changing business needs.

### How It Works

Artie's service offers a fully managed Change Data Capture (CDC) system that ensures your data flows smoothly and accurately from one point to another. Here are the key functionalities:

1. **Connect**: Easily integrate with various databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more.
2. **Configure**: Utilize a user-friendly dashboard to select tables and enable features like ""History Mode"" for auditing historical data.
3. **Deploy**: Seamlessly direct data to various destinations including Snowflake and BigQuery.
4. **Monitor**: Keep track of pipeline performance in real time and receive alerts for any anomalies.

Instead of housing your data, Artie reads directly from your database’s replication log, which means enhanced security and compliance with various regulations.

### The Team and Vision

With a small but dedicated team of seven, guided by Group Partner Jared Friedman, Artie embodies the nimbleness needed in today's fast-paced tech environment. The company has strategically positioned itself within the developer tools and data engineering sectors, taking a strong stance on open-source principles.

### Why Choose Artie?

- **Reduced Latency**: Artie claims to offer 98% or greater reductions in data latency, enabling decision-making at the speed of business.
- **Cost and Resource Efficiency**: Utilizing Artie can lead to a significant decrease in maintenance overhead, freeing your engineering team to focus on product development rather than plumbing.
- **Robust Customer Support**: Artie is already being linked to real success stories at companies like Tatango and Routable, where teams report substantial improvements after implementing Artie.

Founded in 2023 and based in San Francisco, Casca is an innovative fintech startup emerging from Y Combinator's Batch S23. Its mission? To revolutionize banking through the application of AI agents, creating modern alternatives to the outdated technology that has plagued the sector for over three decades.

**What Casca Does**

At the heart of Casca’s offerings is an AI-native Loan Origination System, powered by an intelligent assistant named Sarah. This system automates up to 90% of routine loan processing tasks, allowing small business loan applicants to navigate their applications seamlessly via email or SMS. By removing the cumbersome manual workload, Casca aims to unlock swift, affordable lending options for the 30 million small businesses across the U.S., thereby ensuring they don’t have to resort to high-interest online lenders.

**The Problem Solved**

Traditionally, banks have been hesitant to lend to small businesses due to the labor-intensive nature of the loan application process. Casca addresses this issue directly by streamlining operations, significantly enhancing the speed and efficiency of loan origination. As a result, banks can process loans at rates that previously seemed infinitely unattainable.

**Current Status and Impact**

With a compact team of six, Casca is already making waves in the financial industry, proving successful for FDIC-insured banks and non-bank lenders alike. The results speak for themselves: some institutions have reported tripled lead conversion rates and drastically reduced loan cycle times thanks to Casca’s technology. Noteworthy is Ryan Hildebrand, CIO at Bankwell Bank, who noted tremendous success with Casca's implementation even in the early months.

**Looking Ahead**

Casca is already being recognized as a key player in the fintech space, earning accolades and attention from various financial institutions and industry leaders. As they begin to lead the charge against aging bank systems and help small businesses thrive, their visibility and impact are only expected to grow.

For anyone involved in banking or small business lending—or honestly any interested party—watching Casca’s journey will be both illuminating and perhaps even transformative.

Certainly Health is on a mission to transform the healthcare booking experience, aiming to eliminate surprise medical bills. At its core, the platform offers a marketplace where patients can book doctors with a clear understanding of their out-of-pocket costs, all backed by machine learning technology. Here’s how it works: once patients enter their insurance information and the reason for their visit, Certainly Health predicts and guarantees their costs before they set foot in a doctor's office. For healthcare providers, this means a reliable way to ensure that patients pay their bills.

Founded as part of Y Combinator’s Batch S23, Certainly Health consists of a small but dynamic team of two, operating out of New York City. They aim to provide value not just to patients but also to healthcare providers, ensuring that patients meet their financial obligations without hassle. As for the services offered, Certainly Health caters to a wide array of medical fields, including cosmetic treatments like Botox and dermatology, as well as general medical practices ranging from cardiology to physical therapy.

### Key Offerings:

1. **Cost Transparency**: Patients can compare providers based on guaranteed out-of-pocket costs, rather than vague estimates.
2. **Easy Booking**: Users can book appointments directly through the platform, eliminating the back-and-forth of traditional appointment scheduling.
3. **Provider Partnerships**: Healthcare providers gain access to new patients who are fully informed about their financial commitments.

You can explore their services and book appointments at [Certainly Health](https://certainlyhealth.com).

### The Current Landscape

Though it started as a simple tool for estimating healthcare costs, Certainly Health has grown into a full-fledged service that addresses a chronic pain point in healthcare—unexpected charges.

**Overview:**
CheqUPI, founded in 2021, is India's first UPI wallet tailored specifically for foreign nationals and NRIs. Based in Bengaluru and part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, this fintech startup aims to transform the way international visitors transact while in India. With a compact team of 15, CheqUPI is paving the way for seamless digital payments across the subcontinent.

**Mission:**
CheqUPI's mission is straightforward: enable foreign tourists to navigate India's vibrant market without the hassle of ATM withdrawals or exorbitant foreign exchange fees. With CheqUPI, users can pay at over 55 million merchants throughout India using just their phones.

**Key Features:**
- **UPI Payments:** Users can leverage the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to make transactions effortlessly at a wide array of vendors, including hotels, restaurants, shops, and more.
- **Tourist Wallet:** For a one-time fee of ₹999 (around $12), users can set up a tourist wallet that allows them to manage their payments digitally, avoiding the pitfalls of cash and currency exchanges.
- **Security and Support:** Every transaction is secured with data encryption and two-factor authentication, ensuring users’ safety. CheqUPI also offers proactive support to assist users as they navigate their payment journeys.

**How It Works:**
To start using CheqUPI, foreign nationals must undergo a physical verification process and provide necessary documentation, such as a passport and Indian visa. Once set up, users can load funds onto their wallets via international debit or credit cards, making it a breeze to transact in a cashless manner at millions of points of sale across the country.

**Why Choose CheqUPI?**
1. **Cost-Efficiency:** By minimizing fees associated with cash withdrawals and offering competitive exchange rates, CheqUPI saves money for travelers.

It’s part of the Y Combinator Batch S23, which adds a layer of credibility and connects it with a powerful network in the startup ecosystem. With a small but agile team of two, DisputeNinja focuses on a specific pain point: helping businesses win disputes with Stripe—specifically chargebacks that can eat into a company’s revenue and create unnecessary headaches.

The mission of DisputeNinja is straightforward: they help you ""win Stripe disputes."" When a chargeback occurs—essentially a transaction that the customer disputes or reverses—businesses often find themselves in a complex battle to provide evidence and defend their side. DisputeNinja simplifies this process by acting on behalf of the companies, handling the evidence submission to maximize their chances of winning the dispute. 

Their platform integrates seamlessly with popular services like Stripe and Shopify, allowing users to connect their accounts easily. The setup process is advertised as quick and user-friendly, making it accessible for businesses that may not have extensive resources or experience with disputes.

What really sets DisputeNinja apart is its data-driven approach. They offer insights into which types of evidence are most effective in winning disputes—like customer signatures or access logs—allowing businesses to optimize their strategy over time. This focus on automation and efficiency helps companies reclaim lost revenue and minimize the time spent on disputes, which allows them to focus on growth.

As for pricing, DisputeNinja offers various tiers based on the level of service required. For example, businesses can opt to submit stronger evidence for a higher fee in order to increase their chances of winning disputes dramatically. This flexible pricing structure is an attractive feature for businesses at different stages.

Their website is visually engaging and packed with information, including resources like documentation and pricing details, along with demos for potential clients to explore. 

In summary, DisputeNinja taps into a prevalent challenge in online commerce, taking the complexity out of chargebacks and giving businesses a fighting chance to protect their revenue.

Electrification is at the core of the UK’s net zero strategy. However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand.  With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. 

Elyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.

Our SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.

We connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.

Based in London, this nimble startup consists of a small but dedicated team of seven employees. Their mission is clear: to provide a platform for energy flexibility and demand response.

The core of Elyos Energy's offering is a SaaS platform that helps companies optimize their energy usage, particularly during peak demand periods. By tapping into a range of distributed energy resources (like smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar panels, and batteries), the platform not only aids businesses in slashing their energy costs but also plays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions. The company touts impressive figures—by shifting just 10% of peak time consumption, clients can save around 15% on their electricity bills and cut their CO2 emissions by about 7%.

In a landscape where electrification is key to the UK’s net-zero strategy, Elyos Energy is positioning itself as a solution to the growing mismatch between energy demand and supply, particularly as renewable energy sources become more prevalent and electric vehicles (EVs) gain traction. They are focusing initially on the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK, allowing these entities to play a part in easing the strain on the grid during peak times.

Elyos Energy’s product lineup includes:
- **Elyos Core**: A platform designed for managing energy across multiple buildings using AI-powered insights and anomaly detection.
- **Elyos Pro**: Automates energy use shifts to help businesses save money through integrated Building Management System (BMS) controls.
- **Elyos DR**: Facilitates participation in demand response events, which can financially benefit customers while supporting grid stability.

Their approach is highly relevant today. As the electricity grid evolves, achieving energy flexibility is vital for successfully navigating the increasing demand spurred by mass EV adoption and greater air conditioning needs. 

With strategic guidance from Group Partner Gustaf Alstromer and a clear vision of leveraging energy flexibility on a mass-market scale, Elyos Energy is on a path to help transform how commercial entities manage their energy consumption.

Elythea is a forward-thinking startup dedicated to revolutionizing maternal healthcare through machine learning. Founded in 2023 and part of the Y Combinator Batch S23, Elythea has a bold mission: to predict and prevent pregnancy complications early in the reproductive process. This ambition springs from a sobering statistic: over 80% of maternal deaths are preventable with timely interventions, yet many doctors miss more than half of at-risk mothers until it's almost too late—often waiting until labor starts to assess risks.

With its proprietary machine learning models, Elythea addresses this crucial gap. Their technology swiftly analyzes demographic and clinical risk factors during a woman's first visit, flagging high-risk patients. It targets serious complications like postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia, ensuring that healthcare providers have the foresight to act months in advance. The results? Elythea's clinical studies have demonstrated that they can identify three times as many complications as traditional clinical judgment, and do so ten times earlier.

The startup, based in San Jose, California, operates with a lean team of just two employees and is currently engaged in creating innovative health-tech solutions focused on women's health. They're not just catching complications; they’re changing the conversation around maternal health, emphasizing prevention as a form of care that saves lives.

Located in the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area and part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, the company is currently a lean operation with just two employees. Garry Tan serves as their Group Partner, adding strategic insight to the startup.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S23,,,"Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).

Our AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:

First, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.

Second, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.

Lastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.

Because of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails.

Founded in 2023 and nestled in the heart of San Francisco, Fiber AI is on a mission to revolutionize the way Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) and Business Development Representatives (BDRs) approach prospecting and outbound sales. Think of Fiber AI as your intelligent assistant, automating the grind of finding leads and crafting personalized messages that resonate.

At its core, Fiber AI offers a highly optimized sales platform powered by artificial intelligence. Here’s how it works:

1. **Email Health Management**: First off, Fiber AI ensures that your emails have an 80% open rate—yes, you read that right. This is achieved by configuring your cold email send-outs with best practices that maximize deliverability. They tackle everything from warming up your email accounts to advanced bounce detection—meaning fewer emails landing in spam and more landing in inboxes.

2. **Dynamic Audience Automation**: The platform isn’t just about sending emails; it’s about sending the right emails to the right people. With access to a database of 60 million B2B companies and 800 million contacts sourced from numerous providers (think LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, and Crunchbase), Fiber AI dynamically segments audiences based on precise targeting criteria. This means you can set it and forget it while the AI continually looks for suitable prospects matching your needs.

3. **AI-Powered Hyper-Personalization**: You know that saying, ""it’s not just what you say, but how you say it""? Fiber AI takes that to heart. Leveraging advanced models like GPT-4, the platform crafts hyper-personalized messages that connect with prospects on a deeper level. By finding those “golden nuggets” of information, your outreach doesn’t just get opened; it gets responses.

What makes Fiber AI stand out is its commitment to maintaining high-quality email interactions while dramatically scaling your team’s outreach efforts. Unlike competitors, whose tools often lead to poor email health or lack the ability to fine-tune personalization, Fiber AI combines scalability with quality.

The company is part of the Y Combinator Batch S23 and currently operates with a lean team of eight. Their ethos revolves around empowering Sales teams to achieve up to 1000x their output—without sacrificing the personal touch in their communications.

As Fiber AI picks up momentum, businesses can expect to see a significant boost in their outbound sales efforts. Whether you’re a scrappy startup or a seasoned enterprise, this AI-driven approach might just be the edge you need to connect with prospects like you actually know them. If you’re interested in seeing the magic in action, they invite you to book a demo and explore how Fiber AI can help kick your growth strategy into high gear.

Fortuna Health is a fresh player on the healthcare scene, founded in 2023 and operating out of New York as part of the Y Combinator S23 batch. With just a lean team of six, Fortuna aims to be the ""TurboTax for Medicaid,"" offering a comprehensive one-stop solution for Medicaid navigation—from checking eligibility and enrollment to coverage renewal.

**What They Do**

In an $800 billion Medicaid ecosystem, Fortuna acts as crucial middleware that streamlines the Medicaid experience. Their digital platform ensures that navigating Medicaid is not just easier but also significantly more efficient. Users can complete eligibility checks in as little as 30 seconds without the headache of complicated forms. Fortuna offers guided enrollment and renewal processes tailored to consumers’ unique situations, which means that everything operates much faster and with far fewer barriers.

With a 95% application approval rate, Fortuna enhances consumer experience by removing the traditional friction involved in Medicaid processes. They utilize dynamic state-specific enrollment and provide multilingual support around the clock, making Medicaid accessible to everyone, regardless of their circumstances.

**Key Features**

- **Fast Eligibility Checks**: Users can get speedy screenings for government coverage without complicated steps.
- **Efficient Enrollment/Renewal**: A well-designed interface guides users through the necessary administrative tasks seamlessly.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Fortuna keeps users updated on their application status, ensuring they never miss an important action.
- **Personalized Engagement**: By providing tailored interactions and tools, Fortuna has significantly ramped up renewal rates, with 52% of users completing their tasks the same day.

**Why Fortuna Stands Out**

Fortuna Health is more than just a software solution; it’s built by and for people who have experienced the challenges of navigating Medicaid. They understand the pain points—no one wants to deal with endless paperwork or wait times on hold. By providing a simpler, faster, and more digital experience, Fortuna makes it easy for consumers to access their benefits without unnecessary stress.

**Partnership Opportunities**

Fortuna also welcomes collaboration with health plans and providers interested in offering their clients a smoother Medicaid experience. Their approach can not only improve consumer satisfaction but also contribute positively to bottom lines by minimizing care gaps.

In summary, Fortuna Health is poised to transform the way people interact with Medicaid by making the process efficient and user-friendly.

Founded in 2023 and located in Boulder, Colorado, Foundation aims to revolutionize the homebuilding industry with its innovative approach—essentially, it’s the “Shopify for Homebuilders.” As part of Y Combinator's S23 batch, Foundation is a nimble team of four, working on a mission to transform the buyer experience in real estate.

**What They Do:**
Foundation is fundamentally a digital platform designed to streamline the home buying process. It brings the complexities of shopping for, purchasing, and owning a new home into the digital realm, making it easier and more enjoyable for both homebuilders and buyers. Their core offerings include:

1. **Digital Closing Concierge**: This service guides buyers from contract to closing, offering automated updates and milestone tracking which enhances buyer satisfaction and team efficiency.
   
2. **Ownership Experience**: A dedicated app and portal that allow homeowners to manage their new construction homes seamlessly. From warranty requests to service maintenance, it simplifies post-purchase responsibilities.

3. **Owner Network**: A feature that leverages existing customer relationships to generate referrals and repeat business rather than allowing third-party platforms to capture that traffic.

With a focus on happiness—both for customers and homebuilders—Foundation’s tools promise to drive profitability through happier buyers, fostering more referrals and repeat purchases.

**Why It Matters:**
In the traditional realm of homebuilding, the buying experience often feels outdated and overwhelming. Foundation flips that script. This platform provides not only a modern solution but integrates with existing systems like CRM and construction management for streamlined operations. The result is a win-win: homebuilders can sell more efficiently while customers enjoy a smooth, engaging experience.

The company, which has a modest team of just two based in New York, has set out on an ambitious mission: to simplify on-chain transactions for users. 

So, what exactly does Glide do? At its core, Glide allows users to pay for on-chain transactions using any token they already possess, across any blockchain. This eliminates the cumbersome steps of swapping tokens or bridging assets to settle transactions. Glide is designed with convenience in mind, supporting all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains and hundreds of tokens. The platform makes it seamless for users, whether they’re engaged in cross-chain transactions or comfortable with their existing tokens on a single chain.

Glide targets a dual audience: decentralized applications (dapps) and wallets. By integrating Glide, these platforms can elevate the user experience, enabling transactions with ease—users can pay directly with their current tokens, use credit/debit cards, or even engage with centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. For those without any crypto assets, Glide provides options to purchase crypto on-the-go, ensuring high-intent users complete their transactions without frustration.

One of the standout features of Glide is its pre-built checkout flows. These are optimized for conversion and designed to integrate quickly into dapps. Thanks to Glide's developer-friendly APIs, the integration process is straightforward, often completed within an hour. Developers can choose from customizable UI components or leverage Glide's headless SDK for a tailored experience.

In a space where friction often leads to loss of users and transaction drop-offs, Glide sets itself apart by letting payments occur without the user's need to jump through hoops. It's all about maximizing flexibility—pay from anywhere, even using hardware wallets, and enjoy over 100 tokens supported without ever needing to swap.

**Overview**  
Healthtech 1 is a healthcare technology startup that aims to automate the repetitive processes inherent in healthcare systems, beginning with the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Founded in 2021 and based in London, this burgeoning company operates from the primary care practice of its co-founder, Raj. With a lean team of 13 employees, Healthtech 1 has already integrated its automation solutions into over 400 primary care practices, striving to save thousands of hours of staff time.

**The Mission**  
The crux of Healthtech 1's mission is straightforward: automate healthcare administration to alleviate the burden on health professionals and improve the overall productivity of healthcare systems. By focusing on digital transformation, Healthtech 1 intends to bolster patient care where it’s most needed, and help the NHS emerge from a post-pandemic crisis characterized by declining patient satisfaction and staffing shortages.

**The Need for Change**  
The NHS handles an enormous volume of patient interactions—about 590 million each year. However, following the pandemic, the system is facing significant challenges: patient satisfaction is at a 25-year low, and the NHS is struggling with an 11% recruitment gap, as 1 in 7 staff members are seeking jobs outside the public health system. In this context, automating the myriad repetitive tasks in healthcare is not just advantageous; it's imperative.

**The Approach**  
Healthtech 1 is tackling these issues head-on with solutions like **Automated Registrations** and **Automated GP2GP Filing**.

They focus specifically on alleviating one of the most tedious processes in healthcare administration: dealing with insurance verification calls. 

**Mission**

Their mission is straightforward yet impactful: *Using generative AI to handle insurance calls for healthcare clinics,* effectively saving these clinics up to 40 hours weekly compared to traditional outsourcing methods.

**Key Benefits** 

Health Harbor is not just faster; it’s a whole lot more efficient. Here’s how they stack up against the competition:

1. **Speed**: They offer a turnaround time of 24 hours for benefit verifications, as opposed to the typical 3-day wait from other providers.

- **Benefit Verifications**: They check patient coverage for specific procedures and services—often the information is not clear on insurers’ websites.
- **Prior Authorizations**: They assist in navigating prior auth requirements, submitting requests, and follow-ups.
- **Claim Follow-Up**: They track the status of claims, including why a claim might have been denied.

With their AI capabilities, clinics can expect automated calls to handle these tasks, which helps staff focus on higher-value activities.

**Key Metrics and Market Position**

- They’re reported to be **over 50% cheaper** than traditional call center outsourcing.
- **90% accuracy** in fully automated results, thanks to advanced AI systems.
- They can handle **3,000+ automated calls daily**, expanding their coverage and capabilities continuously.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S23,,,"HyLight builds and operates autonomous airships for long range monitoring. We focus on detecting methane leaks on pipelines and defects on power lines.

Our innovation, the HyLighter, is a crossover between drone and airship technology. Like a drone, it is easily controllable and transportable. And, like an airship, it is extremely energy-efficient, enabling it to fly for up to 10 hours at slow speed (22mph) for optimal data collection which represents a range of 220miles. 

Today, energy infrastructure operators struggle with conducting inspections that are simultaneously: massive and precise. HyLight offers a solution to precisely detect issues on the infrastructure at an industrial scale, and all of this without emitting GHGs.

We are 3 co-founders experienced in hardware and energy companies with Masters in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Business from the best Engineering and Business School in France.

We have developed 5 different flying aircrafts and signed 5 pilots programs with major energy infrastructure operators.

**Mission:** HyLight is set on revolutionizing infrastructure monitoring with small, unmanned hydrogen airships. Their primary focus is on long-range monitoring, specifically detecting methane leaks in pipelines and identifying defects in power lines.

**The Product - HyLighter:**  
Imagine a hybrid between a drone and an airship. That’s the HyLighter. This ingenious piece of technology is not just easy to control and transport like a drone; it’s also exceptionally energy-efficient, allowing it to stay airborne for up to 10 hours at a cruising speed of 22 mph.

**Addressing the Challenge:**  
Energy infrastructure operators face a dual challenge of inspecting vast networks while ensuring precision. Traditional methods often fall short, leaving critical issues undetected. HyLight steps in here, providing industrial-scale precision in monitoring, all without emitting greenhouse gases (GHGs).

**Founders:** The team consists of three co-founders who bring strong backgrounds in hardware and energy sectors, holding master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Business from France's leading institutions.

**Achievements So Far:**  
- Development of five unique flying aircraft models.  
- Secured pilot programs with five major energy infrastructure operators.  
- Letters of Intent (LOIs) worth over $3.5 million.  

**Core Values and Tags:**

Founded in 2023 and based in Limerick, Ireland, Inconvo is a developer-focused startup that’s part of Y Combinator’s S23 batch. It offers an innovative Ask-AI API specifically designed for customer-facing analytics, enabling users to query their data in plain, conversational language.

### Mission and Functionality
Inconvo aims to make it effortless for developers to integrate conversational AI functionality into their applications. Imagine being able to ask questions about your sales, customer engagement, or any data set just like you would chat with a person. Inconvo’s API processes these requests and delivers responses in varied formats, be it a chart, table, or plain text. 

Here’s how it works:
1. **Connect Your Data**: Inconvo seamlessly connects to your existing databases, whether it’s Postgres, MySQL, or others. This means you don’t have to implement a new database; they simply work with what you have.
  
2. **Deploy Ask AI**: Once integrated, you can deploy the AI capabilities in your apps, allowing end-users to interact with their data intuitively.

3. **Analyze and Optimize**: With answers ready at users' fingertips, businesses can enhance analytics, improve user experiences, and drive data-informed decisions.

### Unique Selling Points
- **Multi-tenancy & Access Control**: Inconvo is built to handle multiple users and secure access, making it suitable for a range of applications.
- **Semantic Layer**: The API translates business jargon into database terms, simplifying the technicalities for developers and users alike.
- **Accuracy & Reliability**: Inconvo places a high premium on accuracy. It dynamically generates queries, acknowledges when it can’t answer a question, and continually adapts as analytics evolve.

### Current Status
As of now, Inconvo is in private beta, showcasing its potential to streamline customer analytics drastically. The small team of two keeps the operations agile, relying on insights from their Group Partner, Dalton Caldwell, to guide their strategic direction.

**LifestyleRx** is a health-tech company founded in 2022, based in White Rock, Canada, and part of the Y Combinator Batch S23. Its mission centers around providing virtual care aimed at reversing Type 2 Diabetes through lifestyle changes guided by medical professionals. With a small but dedicated team of nine employees, LifestyleRx has quickly established itself in the telehealth and healthcare sectors as a promising solution for managing and potentially reversing diabetes.

#### Approach to Diabetes Reversal
At the core of LifestyleRx's program is a structured, physician-led, fully virtual 12-week course. Patients across British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario can access this program at no cost, fully covered by provincial health plans. The program emphasizes the **4+2 Diabetes Reversal Strategy**, focusing on six key lifestyle changes involving diet, light exercise, sleep, and stress management. Notably, the approach avoids calorie counting and extreme dietary restrictions, relying instead on sensible eating and moderate physical activity tailored to individual capabilities.

#### How It Works
- **Virtual Group Sessions**: Patients participate in weekly group sessions with a physician, discussing struggles and successes in a supportive environment.
- **Personalized Support**: Each participant receives individual consultations with a doctor from their province to tailor the program to their health history and goals.
- **Educational Resources**: The program includes video lessons, self-assessments, and personal health reports to help patients understand their progress.

LifestyleRx is anchored in clinical evidence that suggests Type 2 Diabetes progression can be reversed by altering lifestyle factors. The emphasis on gradual, sustainable changes encourages participants to adopt healthier habits that stick long after the program concludes.

#### Impact and Testimonials
Patients like Bob, age 73, and Alicia, age 57, have shared their success stories, highlighting dramatic improvements in blood sugar levels and overall health after participating in the program. Feedback emphasizes a wealth of newfound knowledge about diabetes management that many had not encountered in traditional medical settings.

#### Community and Professional Outreach
Beyond direct patient care, LifestyleRx actively engages with health professionals, providing resources for primary care providers and pharmacists to refer patients into their program. This collaborative approach extends their reach and potentially enhances patient outcomes across the community.

#### Conclusion
LifestyleRx is paving the way for a new model of care, leveraging technology to provide accessible and effective treatment options for those battling Type 2 Diabetes. With its evidence-based approach, virtual setup, and focus on lifestyle modifications, it represents a promising shift towards preventive healthcare that could inspire a broader revolution in chronic disease management.

**Overview**  
Founded in 2023 and located in the heart of San Francisco, Mandel AI is on a mission to transform the procurement landscape in manufacturing with its innovative AI-powered solutions. As a participant in Y Combinator’s Batch S23, this startup has set its sights on resolving the age-old inefficiencies of supply chain management through cutting-edge technology.

**Core Mission**  
Mandel AI positions itself as an AI Procurement Agent, specifically designed to streamline and enhance the procurement process for manufacturers. Its goal is to create a real-time, self-updating source of truth for the supply chain, where data is automatically extracted and suppliers are proactively contacted for order updates. This moves the needle from reactive to proactive supply chain management, reducing the risks associated with delays and disruptions.

**What They Do**  
Mandel AI employs a suite of features that modernize procurement:  
- **Automated Data Extraction:** AI extracts supply chain details from emails and documents, ensuring no critical updates slip through the cracks.  
- **Intelligent Monitoring of Orders:** The AI actively follows up with suppliers to keep track of order statuses, preventing nasty surprises.  
- **Autonomous RFQs (Requests for Quotes):** The system can engage with suppliers on its own to gather quotes, making procurement more efficient.  
- **Auto-Reconcile:** This feature helps in quickly identifying and correcting discrepancies in packing lists, ensuring accuracy throughout the supply chain.

**The Need for Innovation**  
The traditional methods of managing supply chains—essentially stuck in the era of email and spreadsheets—have proven to be inadequate, especially as global logistics become increasingly complex. Disruptions can cost businesses around **$1.6 trillion** annually, a staggering figure that highlights the urgency for innovative solutions like those offered by Mandel AI. Their mantra? “Never chase suppliers again.”

**The Team**  
Mandel AI is a lean operation with a dedicated team of three, guided by seasoned venture partner Harj Taggar. This compact team is focused on building a solution that integrates seamlessly into existing workflows, making the supply chain as easy to manage as checking your phone.

**Conclusion**  
In a world where supply chain disruptions can paralyze businesses, Mandel AI's proactive approach offers a promising lifeline. By leveraging the power of generative AI, Mandel AI is not just keeping pace with industry needs; it's redefining them. Your supply chain could soon be as smooth as a well-oiled machine.

**Overview**  
Founded in 2023 and hailing from San Francisco, PropRise is an innovative player in the commercial real estate sector, leveraging artificial intelligence to function as a round-the-clock investment analyst. By moving beyond traditional listings, PropRise helps firms discover hidden opportunities that are easily overlooked. Think of it as the smart friend who knows all the insider tips on where to find the best investment prospects.

**The Mission**  
PropRise’s core mission is clear: transform how investment opportunities are discovered and evaluated in commercial real estate. By analyzing not just financials but also local council meetings, community sentiment, and market trends, PropRise equips investors with comprehensive insights that lead to smarter decisions.

**The Problem**  
Navigating the self-storage market—and indeed the broader commercial real estate landscape—can feel like finding a needle in a haystack. Investors often struggle with identifying quality properties and managing various opportunities due to outdated tools and limited data. It's a classic case of missing the forest for the trees. PropRise seeks to eliminate these barriers, offering a platform that simplifies this journey.

**How They Solve It**  
At the heart of PropRise is its **Discovery Engine**, an AI-powered tool designed for powerful deal sourcing. It enables users to spot prime self-storage opportunities through a robust search mechanism that includes location details, demographics, rents, and supply data. PropRise also goes the extra mile by offering comprehensive market analytics, with automated alerts that keep investors ahead of the curve on new listings and market shifts.

**The Team**  
To turn this vision into reality, PropRise boasts a tight-knit team of three employees. Among them are co-founders Jean-Michael Diei (CEO) and Matthew Krager (CTO), along with Kenny Sandon as Director of Sales. They’re supported by Jared Friedman as their Group Partner at Y Combinator, where PropRise was part of the Batch S23 program.

**User Testimonials**  
The value of PropRise speaks volumes through the words of its users. One VP of Development noted, “PropRise eliminates 75% of the manual work of searching for deals.” Another user pointed out that the platform drastically reduces the time it takes to identify valuable sites—a crucial edge in a competitive market.

**The Bottom Line**  
As PropRise continues to shape the commercial real estate investment landscape, it’s clear they’re unlocking an unfair advantage for investors. By marrying AI with real estate, they’re not just finding opportunities; they’re redefining how deals are sourced and analyzed. If you're in the market for commercial real estate investments, you might want to consider what PropRise can do for you.

The AI is designed to pull precise information, complete with source citations, ensuring that what you get is not just timely, but also accurate.

Their Excel extension adds even more power: it updates your models automatically with fresh data from earnings releases, eradicating the drudgery of manual updates. This kind of integration boosts an analyst’s productivity, allowing them to cover more ground with the same time investment.

Quill AI has also developed robust features like historical financial data retrieval, real-time alerts for SEC filings, and extensive context for earnings call metrics. Analysts at major firms like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are already using Quill to sharpen their insights and improve their reporting.

Founded in 2023 and hailing from the bustling tech scene of New York, RecipeUI is carving out a niche as the go-to open source alternative to Postman. The mission here is straightforward yet ambitious: to democratize API debugging across teams, making it accessible not just to backend engineers but to everyone from frontend developers to product managers and QA testers.

The inception of RecipeUI can be traced back to its early days at Robinhood, where it quickly gained traction as the first version was embraced by 100% of the engineering and QA teams. This viral adoption speaks volumes about its utility — when an API breaks, anyone involved can jump in and help identify the issue, reducing bottlenecks and increasing overall efficiency.

Currently, the company is a lean operation with a team of just two, operating under the guidance of Dalton Caldwell as their Group Partner in the Y Combinator Batch S23. RecipeUI is tagged with important categories like 'developer-tools', 'open-source', 'api', and 'new-york', laying the groundwork for what they hope to build.

**Overview**: Founded in 2023 and nestled in the tech-savvy heart of San Francisco, SafetyKit is revolutionizing how enterprises handle trust and safety management. Backed by Y Combinator’s Batch S23, this nimble startup is on a mission to ditch the outdated reliance on human reviewers by introducing an AI-powered solution that automates the content review process.

**Mission**: SafetyKit aims to enhance trust and safety automation through cutting-edge language models, enabling teams to scale their operations and reduce costs.

- **Speed & Efficiency**: Amplifies decision-making efficiency by 5x or even removes the need for human intervention altogether.
- **Human-Level Accuracy**: Capable of processing up to 20,000 reviews per minute, ensuring 100% adherence to defined policies.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Unlike generic models, SafetyKit takes into account the entire context, including text and multimedia, offering nuanced understanding for complex situations.
- **Policy-Backed Decisions**: All actions are documented with detailed explanations, thus ensuring a transparent and accountable review process.

**Use Cases**:
- Enforcing marketplace rules to keep prohibited goods off platforms.
- Automating user report handling to identify issues proactively, mitigating potential escalations.
- Ensuring user-generated content meets stringent safety standards without costly human oversight.

**Team**: Comprising only 7 skilled employees, led by industry veterans David Graunke (formerly of Stripe) and Steven Guichard (ex-CEO of Carbic), SafetyKit leverages deep expertise in risk management and TnS.

**Backed By**: Prominent venture firm Y Combinator, alongside notable partners such as Gustaf Alstromer, ensuring strong support for growth.

**In a Nutshell**: SafetyKit is not just a solution; it’s a paradigm shift in trust and safety management.

Founded in 2023 and headquartered in New York, Santé is an innovative player in the fintech space, specifically targeting liquor stores with its all-in-one point-of-sale (POS) system. As part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, it's clear this startup has ambitions to shake up the retail landscape for liquor and wine shops.

**Mission Statement:**
Santé aims to provide a comprehensive POS solution that consolidates receiving, e-commerce, and delivery apps into a single, user-friendly platform, thereby simplifying operations and boosting revenue for liquor retailers.

**Team and Partnerships:**
With a lean team of just two employees, the company is guided by the insights of Jared Friedman, a Group Partner at Y Combinator. Despite its small size, Santé is making waves in the B2B domain, focusing heavily on the retail side of fintech.

**What Makes Santé Stand Out?**
1. **Comprehensive Functionality:** 
   - The POS system integrates not just cash sales but also e-commerce and delivery app management.
   - Features include AI-powered inventory management, which streamlines stock handling and optimizes reorder processes.
   
2. **Modern Hardware:** 
   - The system is designed for fast, reliable in-store processing, making it easy for staff to handle transactions quickly.

3. **User-Focused Design:** 
   - The interface is straightforward enough to reduce training time for new employees, making transitions smoother for liquor businesses moving from older systems.

4. **Customer-Centric Approach:**
   - Santé has established a reputation for responsiveness with 24/7 US-based customer support, ensuring that users have their problems solved promptly.

5. **Integrations:**

**Conclusion:**

Founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, SID aims to make the integration of AI with company-specific data seamless and efficient. The mission is straightforward: provide a serverless Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution that empowers AI to tap into relevant information tailored to both industries and individual users.

Initially, SID began by easing the path for developers who struggled with setting up data connections to their large language model (LLM) applications. Instead of enduring a lengthy integration process or grappling with cumbersome data retrieval pipelines, developers could simply add SID’s button to their tools—much like Reworkd's AgentGPT did in just a day. This leap has allowed countless users to instantly link their Notion, email, and Google Drive to their AI functionalities.

As the AI landscape continues to expand, every new player seems to be reinventing the wheel when it comes to data retrieval. SID believes this shouldn’t be the case. In the same vein that OpenAI democratized access to LLMs through a simple API call, SID aspires to do the same for data accessibility. They’re not just another tech solution; they’re fundamentally changing how AI companies interact with data.

**Current Focus and Offerings**

SID is currently working on the following key initiatives:
- **Developer Accessibility**: They provide resources and documentation to help developers get started quickly. With tools designed to enhance product functionality, SID invites devs to explore their offerings through demos and user-friendly guides.
- **RAG Solutions**: The focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation displays SID's intent to be at the forefront of AI technology advancements, ensuring that AI applications are informed and contextually aware based on user, industry, or company-specific data.

With a compact team of 3, SID is nimble and focused. They are geared toward building out their product and expanding their capabilities, guided under the expertise of their group partner, Dalton Caldwell.

**Concluding Thoughts**

In a landscape where data retrieval is a crucial enabler of AI's capabilities, SID is positioning itself as a key player to simplify this process. It’s a bold move—just when it seems like AI's evolution might plateau, companies like SID remind us that the race is not just about intelligence but also about how effectively we can connect that intelligence to the real world.

Stellar Sleep uses psychology to help these people break the insomnia cycle.",2021.0,"[{'name': 'George W, Founder', 'description': ""George's founder bio"", 'linkedin': 'https://linkedin.com/in/wang-george'}, {'name': 'Edrei Chua, Founder', 'description': None, 'linkedin': 'https://linkedin.com/in/edreichua'}]","**Stellar Sleep: Your Partner in Overcoming Insomnia**

Founded in 2021 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, Stellar Sleep is revolutionizing how we approach chronic insomnia—an issue that plagues 25 million Americans with often overlooked psychological roots. The company's mission is straightforward: to help people conquer insomnia through tailored psychological strategies rather than superficial remedies like cutting coffee or resorting to meditation.

### The Problem

Chronic insomnia is more than just a sleep issue; it’s a complex challenge that frequently stems from deeper psychological problems such as anxiety and stress. Many traditional treatments miss this mark, leaving sufferers with barely scratched surfaces. This is exactly why Stellar Sleep exists—to address these root causes head-on.

### How It Works

Their approach is clear and effective. Users begin by taking a free online sleep quiz designed to assess their unique sleep patterns and life factors. Based on the results, Stellar Sleep then crafts a personalized program rooted in proven behavioral therapy techniques. 

Here’s the gist:
1. **Online Sleep Quiz**: Understand your sleep state.
2. **Personalized Program**: Get a bespoke plan focused on psychological solutions.
3. **Long-lasting Results**: Cultivate skills that lead to sustainable sleep improvements rather than quick fixes.

### The Science Behind Stellar Sleep

Stellar Sleep isn’t just throwing random tips at you. Their strategies utilize evidence-based techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). These methods address various aspects of insomnia, employing techniques like Sleep Restriction Therapy, Cognitive Restructuring, and more. 

### Not Just Another App

This isn’t just any sleep app. Stellar Sleep has been recognized with multiple awards, including the first place in the 2022 Digital Health Innovation Awards for Best Overall SleepTech Solution. Users rave about the app, with an impressive average rating of 4.8 from over 500 reviews. Feedback echoes a common sentiment: it works—really works.

### Real User Experience

A user noted a substantial turnaround after weeks of sleepless nights. “I literally had slept 0 minutes for weeks,” they said. But, after utilizing Stellar Sleep, they began to see real improvement—sleep every night. Another user shared how the app’s focus on psychological techniques rather than generic meditation profoundly changed their sleep quality, increasing their nightly rest from 6 to a solid 7-8 hours.

### Join the Sleep Revolution

If you're among the millions struggling with sleep, Stellar Sleep offers a lifeline. The app promises not just to help you fall asleep but to transform your relationship with sleep—forever. With techniques that only take about 10 minutes a day, it's designed to fit seamlessly into your life.

Surface Labs is a fresh player in the B2B marketing landscape, founded in 2023 and part of the Y Combinator Batch S23. At its core, Surface Labs is dedicated to helping marketing teams enhance their website conversions by optimizing the often neglected intake forms—those ""Contact Us,"" ""Request a Demo,"" or ""Talk to Sales"" forms that are ubiquitous but, frankly, underwhelming in their current form.

### The Problem

Most forms are like poorly designed vending machines: you put something in and hope for the best, but good luck getting anything useful out. The result? High dropout rates and lost opportunities. Surface Labs recognized that these forms need robust analytics and personalization to truly engage users and capture valuable information. 

### The Solution

With a team of just five and led by Group Partner Garry Tan, Surface Labs has crafted tools that integrate seamlessly into existing websites. They promise to capture 50% more emails, de-anonymize website visitors, and auto-qualify leads without the heavy lifting traditionally required by marketing teams. They've previously collaborated with companies like Snowflake and various startups, gaining key insights into what makes conversion processes successful.

Their main offerings include:

- **Intelligent Lead Forms**: These aren't your run-of-the-mill forms. They're multi-step, visually appealing, and able to collect partial information while enabling easy follow-ups.
  
- **De-Anonymization**: Forget the frustration of anonymous site visitors. Surface Labs provides person-level de-anonymization coupled with lead scoring, so businesses know exactly who’s visiting their site.

- **Multi-Channel Ad Orchestration**: They can help generate conversion-optimized PPC and SEO pages automatically, making ad spends more effective.

### What’s Next?

If you’re struggling to convert visitors into leads, Surface Labs claims to be a game-changer. They offer personalized demos to showcase how their tools can directly benefit businesses.

You can visit them online at [withsurface.com](https://withsurface.com) to see their products in action and learn more about their pricing, funnels, or even read their blog for tips on conversion optimization.

### Testimonies of Trust

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,S23,,,SyntheticFi offers a low cost and low hassle solution for independent financial advisors (RIAs) to meet the liquidity needs of their clients.,2023.0,"[{'name': 'Tony Yang, Founder', 'description': 'Ex-Stripe. UC Berkeley class of 2020. Personal finance nerd.', 'linkedin': 'https://linkedin.com/in/yucheng-tony-yang'}]","**SyntheticFi: Revolutionizing Securities-Backed Lending**

Founded in 2023 and part of Y Combinator's Batch S23, SyntheticFi is a fintech startup based in San Francisco with a clear mission: to provide the cheapest way for investors to gain liquidity from their stock investments. With a compact team of just two employees and backed by notable figures like Jared Friedman from Y Combinator, the company seeks to redefine how independent financial advisors (RIAs) can access cash without the traditional hassle.

### What Do They Do?

SyntheticFi is all about offering low-cost, straightforward solutions for financial advisors to meet their clients' liquidity needs. Their innovations revolve around securities-backed lending, allowing clients to secure loans at interest rates that are typically 1% - 3% lower than existing products. They achieve this by utilizing a strategy known as box spreads, an efficient way of accessing the institutional borrowing market directly through stock exchanges. 

Clients benefit from:
- **Lower Interest Rates**: Interest rates typically pegged at SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) + 0.50%, with current rates as low as 4.83%.
- **No Extra Paperwork**: Unlike traditional lenders that require a significant amount of documentation, SyntheticFi streamlines the process with fully digital onboarding, eliminating unnecessary delays.
- **Flexibility**: They operate like a line of credit, allowing clients to keep their balance open possibly indefinitely. Funds can be used for any purpose, and repayment can align with clients' needs.

### Why SyntheticFi Matters

In an investment landscape often bogged down by complex procedures and high fees, SyntheticFi shines. Its user-friendly approach taps into the growing demand for efficiency in financial services, especially for those managing large portfolios. They support various custodians like Charles Schwab, which means clients don’t need to shift their assets, preserving their existing financial relationships.

### The Road Ahead

With one year under their belt and a vision to innovate further, SyntheticFi is an exciting player in the fintech scene. By delivering a compelling mix of lower costs, streamlined processes, and advisor-focused solutions, they're looking to carve out a significant space in securities-backed lending—and potentially reshape how investors think about liquidity from stocks.

Founded in 2021 and hailing from the innovative hub of Berlin, Germany, Truemetrics is on a mission to redefine how last-mile deliveries are executed. In partnership with Y Combinator’s S23 batch, they’re tackling a crucial issue in delivery logistics: the often-broken navigation systems that cause delays and frustrations for couriers.

**The Problem: Broken Navigation**

The statement ""You Have Arrived At Your Destination!"" doesn’t ring true for many couriers. They often find themselves stuck searching for parking space or figuring out complex building entrances. A staggering 15% of all navigation pins can be over 70 meters away from the actual entrance, wasting valuable delivery seconds—time that could mean the difference between a satisfied customer and a frustrated one.

**The Solution: Entrance and Parking Location Data**

Truemetrics provides a smart solution by harnessing sophisticated sensor data from drivers' smartphones. This allows them to generate precise coordinates for parking spots and building entrances. By integrating this data into their systems, couriers can save anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes on each delivery. Imagine that multiplied across hundreds of deliveries—it's a potential game changer for logistics companies.

What sets Twenty apart is its commitment to making customer relationship management both powerful and accessible.

Think of it as the Swiss Army knife for CRM—robust, flexible, and designed to adapt to the fast-paced environment of a growing company.

It allows users to design workflows tailored to their business needs, making it perfect for companies that need to pivot quickly. Its functionality includes powerful APIs, customizable objects, and support for integrating various data sources. 

But the appeal of Twenty goes beyond just functionality. It fosters a thriving community where developers share expertise and contribute to continuous improvement of the platform. If you’re missing a feature, you can easily start a conversation or contribute code. It’s all about building something better, together.

The feedback from users has been overwhelmingly positive, with community members expressing excitement about the project and its potential impact in the market. Developers, businesses, and enthusiasts alike are recognizing the momentum behind Twenty as a serious contender in the CRM space.

As the landscape of software continues to evolve, Twenty represents not just a tool, but a movement towards transparency, customization, and user empowerment in customer relationship management.

The mission is clear: to simplify banking for young entrepreneurs and everyday users alike, leveraging mobile technology to transform how people manage their finances.

Imagine you’re a young Congolese entrepreneur who just landed a contract with a major mining company. In the past, the only way to set up your business banking was by spending hours waiting in line at a physical bank. With VaultPay, you can open both personal and business accounts directly from your smartphone, receive payments, and carry out transactions—all without the hassle. This is not just innovation; it's a revolution in how banking is approached in the DRC.

Located in Kinshasa with a team of just two employees, VaultPay is part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2023 batch. They boast an impressive backing from notable investors, including Group Partner Michael Seibel. Their services are streamlined and hassle-free, promoting a user-friendly interface that allows anyone to open an account within a minute. They even offer a virtual VISA card that users can start using immediately after signing up, and a physical card can be delivered in just 24 hours—something that’s a bit of a big deal in the region!

VaultPay is categorized under terms like fintech, payments, B2B, and neobanking, which reflects its innovative approach to financial services. The app offers the convenience of 24/7 access to funds, real-time expense tracking, and even cashback incentives on card payments—the sort of features that are commonplace in more developed markets but quite rare in the DRC.

Security-wise, they are committed to safeguarding user data with top-notch protection practices, including PCI-DSS compliance. Their application has been developed by a team with experience from top tech companies, ensuring a robust and reliable user experience.

In short, VaultPay is not just another banking app; it’s a tool designed to make financial management straightforward and accessible for everyone in DRC.

VetRec adopts a straightforward pricing model:

Vigilant is designed to feel as intuitive as an integrated development environment (IDE), so developers can focus on what really matters: building great products. The tool enables users to instantly search through logs, receive alerts when things go sideways, and even debug before users start complaining.

- **Intuitive Search:** Quickly filter logs by various attributes—no more endless scrolls to find what's broken.
- **Custom Alerts:** Get notified about important log messages or errors in real-time.
- **Simple Integration:** Just a single code snippet, and you're ready to roll. It accommodates existing logging setups without requiring major changes—works with popular languages like Node.js, Python, and Go.

### The Team & Backers

With a lean team of just two, Vigilant is backed by Dalton Caldwell as their Group Partner from Y Combinator's Batch S23. Their vision is substantial, but they're tackling it step by step, focusing on startups that need a foolproof way to manage logs without diving into overly complex systems.

### Pricing & Availability

Founded in 2023, Wattson Health is a fresh player in the healthcare tech arena, born from the startling statistic that medication errors cost the industry a whopping $40 billion annually. The culprit? Manual processes in pharmacies. To tackle this, Wattson Health has developed an automation platform that seamlessly integrates with existing pharmacy systems to process prescriptions in seconds, eliminating human error and significantly slashing wait times.

Imagine going from hours or even days of prescription management to a smooth operation that takes moments—this is what Wattson Health promises. Their AI-driven technology automates essential pharmacy tasks like refills, adherence tracking, and transfers while sounding like your friendly neighborhood pharmacist—no robotic monotone here. The goal is straightforward: reduce phone calls to pharmacies and free up staff to focus on patient care.

Backed by Y Combinator in its S23 Batch, Wattson Health operates with a lean team of just three employees, all committed to making pharmacy workflows more efficient. Their innovative AI voice agents not only handle repetitive tasks but also glean insights into patient needs, offering features like clear call summaries, easy access to conversation history, and intuitive analytics.

What sets Wattson apart? They offer customizable workflows tailored specifically to each pharmacy’s unique challenges, allowing for swift integration that can happen in days rather than weeks. Compliance is also a priority; their systems ensure HIPAA standards are met, protecting patient information.
