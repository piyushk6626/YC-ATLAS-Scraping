Legalist is a tech-enabled asset management firm based in San Francisco, specializing in alternative investments. Founded in 2016 and part of Y Combinator's Summer 2016 batch, the company initially focused on esoteric private credit assets specifically in litigation and bankruptcy. Since launching its first fund in 2017, Legalist has grown to manage over $1 billion in technology-driven alternative investments, which cater to endowments, foundations, hospitals, insurance companies, and family offices.

**Mission and Focus Areas**

Legalist's mission revolves around leveraging technology to enhance asset management processes. They apply artificial intelligence to sift through vast public datasets, identifying investment opportunities that are typically overlooked. Their core strategies include:

- **Litigation Finance**: Providing funding for legal cases in exchange for a portion of the settlement.
- **Bankruptcy**: Investing in distressed assets that emerge during bankruptcies.
- **Government Receivables**: Securing investments based on anticipated payments from government entities.

**Team and Leadership**

The Legalist team comprises approximately 40 dedicated employees, with leadership from co-founders Christian Haigh and Eva Shang, both serving as General Partners. Their background in finance and technology equips the firm to navigate the complex landscape of alternative asset management. 

**Why Legalist Stands Out**

The unique blend of legal acumen and tech innovation positions Legalist at the intersection of fintech and legaltech. Their systematic approach not only seeks uncorrelated yield for institutional investors but also offers scalability in sourcing alternative asset investments.

**Mission:** New Incentives is on a mission that speaks volumes: ""Cash transfers that save lives."" This nonprofit organization is focused on improving childhood vaccination rates by encouraging Nigerian mothers to immunize their infants against preventable diseases.

**Founded and Location:** Established as part of Y Combinator’s S16 batch, New Incentives is headquartered in San Francisco. With a dedicated team of 51 employees, they are leveraging technology and data to amplify their impact.

**What They Do:** Their approach is straightforward but highly effective: New Incentives provides cash incentives to families after their children receive vaccinations at government clinics. This isn’t just about handing out cash; it’s about creating a reliable system that ensures children get the care they need. They also help raise awareness about vaccination benefits and work to improve local vaccine supply chains.

**Measured Impact:** The results are compelling:
- Over 4.5 million infants have been served by their program.
- Nearly 19 million cash transfers have been issued after vaccination verification.
- A stunning 86% retention rate ensures that families remain engaged throughout the vaccination cycle.

In independent trials, New Incentives demonstrated significant increases in vaccination coverage:
- A 108% increase in full vaccination rates.
- A 62% increase in timely measles vaccinations.
- A 180% improvement in clinics avoiding stockouts of vaccines.

With data updated daily, it’s clear that New Incentives is making strides where it matters most, addressing child mortality rates in Nigeria—where approximately 40% of deaths among children under five are due to vaccine-preventable diseases.

**Why It Matters:** Every 19 seconds, a child dies from a vaccine-preventable disease. New Incentives tackles this grim reality head-on, proving that financial incentives can align public health goals with urgent humanitarian needs.

**Funding and Recognition:** This organization has garnered recognition from esteemed charity evaluators and funders, attaining vital support that allows them to operate effectively while striving to be one of the most cost-effective charities in the world.

Women Who Code (WWCode) is a nonprofit organization on a mission to empower diverse women to excel in technology careers. Founded in 2013, the organization began as a grassroots movement in San Francisco in 2011, initiated by a small group of engineers seeking a supportive community.
